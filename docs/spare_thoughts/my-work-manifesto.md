# Things I think are important
- state the problem up front -- a problem well-stated is a problem half-solved, and stating the problem instead of starting with solutions leaves more opportunities for solutions
- building resilient organizations is important -- learning is how you continuously improve. You rarely start with a culture that is optimized for this sort of evolution
- most problems are communications problems first and foremost. resolving the communication problem very often resolves the underlying problem
- break big decisions into small, reversible decisions -- this mitigates risk and sunk cost
- in any communication, start with the important, high-level stuff up front -- then give more details down low. bullet points and headings are helpful.
