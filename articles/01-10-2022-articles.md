_Embracing habit in an automated world_
Meghan Oâ€™Gieblyn
The author argues the case for habit in an increasing automated world, moving through historical antecedents for habit compared to spontaneity. Historically, rote habit had been considered something less than human, the bits of us that make us human are the things that we don't do on autopilot. Author brings up the ALM hypothesis, which states that digital technology behaves as substitutes for routine cognitive occupations and as compliments for non-routine occupations. But with an increasingly bizarre world where the worker is divorced from the products of their labor (AI black boxes), this concept of freedom is increasingly unattainable.
