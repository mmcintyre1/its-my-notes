# It's My Notes
This is a place where I write about things I've learned about. My so-called knowledge portfolio. I borrowed a lot from [this repo](https://github.com/keyvanakbary/learning-notes) since I love the simplicity and his project structure means 0 setup.

## Running Locally

## Organizing the nav order
There is a python script at `./scripts/sort_nav_order.py` that you can run that will reorder all the nav orders of each book in each directory in the `DIRS_TO_ORDER` list based on `last_modification_date`. You just need to run it via `python ./scripts/sort_nav_order.py` when at the project root. It will change most files, so they'll need to be recommitted and pushed up again.
