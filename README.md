# Learning Notes

Taking notes on books I read, talks I watch, articles I study, and papers I love – recalling them right afterward by creating short summaries – helps a lot in my learning process. Here you'll find some of those little pieces.

If you are looking for an easy way to consume these notes, please check out [keyvanakbary.github.io/learning-notes/](https://keyvanakbary.github.io/learning-notes/).

## Contributing

This is my personal learning space. I keep it for my enjoyment, if you are thinking about adding your summaries it may be a better idea to start your own.

If you have any suggestions for improvement please feel free to open a pull request.

Thanks!
