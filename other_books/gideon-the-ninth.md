# Gideon the Ninth

## Why I read this book
---
The book got a ton of praise by a ton of publications, and was shortlisted for the Nebula, and won the Locus for "Best First Novel". The second book, _Harrow the Ninth_ is receiving similar praise, and I love a good sci-fi/fantasy trilogy/tetralogy.

## Summary
---
All the houses are invited to first house to train to be Lycars for the God Undead guy.
## How was the book
---
- you may love or hate the dialogue -- Gideon talks like a millenial and the novel is set in some far off impossible place so you'd be expecting folks to be speaking that bygone-ese you hear in fantasy novels, a stilted too-formal approximation of Shakespeare rendered in prose.
- everything is in service of the plot -- there is a will-they won't they dynamic, but there is nothing overly sexual about this novel despite the lesbian lead. It's a hallmark of how far the genre has come in a short 50 years to normalize this type of main character, to have her sexuality only be a minor facet of her character. It's refreshing.
- There are times where I struggled with the action being depicted, lost in who was doing what. The first time I really noticed it was when Gideon was fighting a large skeletal construct at the behest of her necromancer, Harrow. I got the gist of the action and sort of made up my own pacing, as you could tell the scene would end with the construct deconstructed.
- It really is a great example of world-building. There is so much detail under the surface of this world, and the way your understanding of it unfolded with the narrative was a real joy. Great science fiction and fantasy series are as much about their worlds as they are their characters or their plots -- if the world is interesting enough, you could plop in a bunch of automatons getting coffee and you'd have a nice novel.
- This novel is chock-full of references to the Bible, classic literature, history, or countless other topics. It's a slim chance that any detail, any characters name, any bit of this novel, is chosen haphazardly.

N/A -- The prose doesn't crackle and most everything is in service of plot here.
