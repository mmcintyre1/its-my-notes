# Gideon the Ninth

## Why I read this book
---
The book got a ton of praise by a ton of publications, and was shortlisted for the Nebula, and won the Locus for "Best First Novel". The second book, _Harrow the Ninth_ is receiving similar praise, and I love a good sci-fi/fantasy trilogy/tetralogy.

## How was the book
---
- You may love or hate the dialogue -- Gideon talks like a millennial and the novel is set in some far off impossible place so you'd be expecting folks to be speaking that bygone-ese you hear in fantasy novels, a stilted too-formal approximation of Shakespeare rendered in prose. It's exceptionally playful, and there was a minute in the beginning where I thought I might not want to continue on with the book as I was worried the dialogue would eventually grate or veer into an almost unintentional satire. Fortunately it was a passing feeling, and Muir has an excellent sense for story pacing and dialogue in service of the plot. There are plenty of puns and modern-day colloquialisms, if that is your sort of thing. I would call it less funny than that it doesn't take it's dialogue as deathly serious as other fantasy/sci-fi novels.
- There is a will-they won't they dynamic between leads Harrow, the Ninth House necromancer, and Gideon, her cavalier or sworn sword, but there is nothing overly sexual about this novel despite the lesbian lead. It's a hallmark of how far the genre has come in a short 50 years to normalize this type of main character, to have her sexuality only be a minor facet of her character. It's refreshing to have come so far.
- There are times where I struggled with the action being depicted, lost in who was doing what. The first time I really noticed it was when Gideon was fighting a large skeletal construct at the behest of her necromancer, Harrow. I got the gist of the action and sort of made up my own pacing, as you could tell the scene would end with the construct deconstructed. The action scenes are balletic, Gideon wielding a rapier in defense while Harrow conjures, and this is difficult to depict narratively.
- It really is a great example of world-building. There is so much detail under the surface of this world, and the way your understanding of it unfolded with the narrative was a real joy. Great science fiction and fantasy series are as much about their worlds as they are their characters or their plots -- if the world is interesting enough, you could pace some automatons getting coffee and you'd have a compelling read.
- This novel is chock-full of references to the Bible, classic literature, history, or countless other topics. Everything was chosen with purpose and double meaning. I'd recommend reading the "A Little Explanation of the Naming System" at the end before Act 2 for pronunciation help. I didn't, and I wasn't even close. Hermy-one, anyone?
- I will certainly be reading the rest of this series, as Muir lays out enough thread to tease a very compelling tetralogy (it's up to 4 books now with Alecto being announced as the penultimate book after Harrow the Ninth and before Nina the Ninth, which tickles me with a through-line of the Grecian furies being subtext).
- Most of the novel takes place in the falling-apart Canaan House (not sure what the importance of Canaan is in the name other than as an ethnic group that crops up from time to time in the Bible), but this very much feels like a Gothic Novel trope, harkening back to Northanger Abbey or Fall of the House of Usher. It's a cross between Clue and an escape house.
