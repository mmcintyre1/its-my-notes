# The Three Kingdoms, Volume 2: The Sleeping Dragon

## Pronunciation Guide
### Consonants
`x` - The best way to think of x is as an "sh" sound. This is not quite accurate, as "sh" is also used in Chinese and has a subtly different pronunciation. For those interested in understanding the distinction, the "sh" in Pinyin is much closer to the typical English sh, while "x" is pronounced with the tongue near the front of the mouth.

`c` - This is a "ts" sound, NOT a k sound. Chinese also has the k sound, but it is (unsurprisingly) represented in Pinyin with a k.

`zh` - This is most similar to an English j or hard soft g. Like with "x", this is not quite accurate, but it's close enough. Chinese also has another j, but (like with "x" and "sh") it is made with the tongue closer to the front of the mouth, while zh is made with the tongue further back. This means Dong Zhuo should not be pronounced the same as "Dong Zuo", but rather more like "Dong Juo"

`q` - This is basically a ch sound, though Chinese also has another "ch". Just like "x/sh" and "j/zh", the difference between "q" and "ch" is that q is pronounced with the tongue at the front of the mouth (almost to the point that you're touching your front teeth with it) while ch is pronounced with the tongue much further back.

### Vowel Sounds
`ou` and `uo` - This is one of the more frustrating ones to hear. In Chinese, ou is pronounced the same as you pronounce the word "Oh". On the other hand, uo does not have an English equivalent. The best I can give is the beginning of the world "woah": essentially just the "wo", before you transition to the "oh" sound at the end.

`e` - This is not a long e sound, but rather a schwa -- the same sound as in "uh".

`a` - This is a short a, as in "mama", except when it follows a "y", in which case it becomes the same vowel as in "men"

`i` - Usually, this is a long e, as in "treat". However, it can also be the vowel sound in "her"; this happens when it follows "sh", "zh", "ch", or "r". And it has a third sound when it follows "z", "c" and "s", which is most similar to "uh". (There's no real English equivalent to this third sound.)

`u` - The vowel sound in "too".

`ü` - This one is tricky, because it's actually different than the u above and there's no direct English equivalent. It is similar to "u" except heavily nasalized. (Inconveniently, Lü Bu has both "u" and "ü" in his name. These are different!)

`iu` - Unfortunately, this is a bit different than just "i" and "u" stuck together. It is a long "e" followed by the "yo" in "yo-yo" -- "ee-yo" -- but glided together so it is only one syllable.

`ei` - The vowel sound in "may"

`ao` - The vowel sound in "now"

`ua` - Adding the "u" in front of the "a" changes the "a" sound to a schwa.
