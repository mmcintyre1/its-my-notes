# The Bone Clocks

## Why I read this book
---
This is my 4th Mitchell novel, having read _Cloud Atlas_, _Ghostwritten_, and _The Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet_ before this. He might be the best writer I've read currently writing in English -- blending an entertainer's flourish for narrative and the stylistic virtuosity of a "serious" fiction writer.

## Summary
---
This book spaces six narratives revolving around a Holly Sykes, foreground for a gods versus men backdrop of atemporals, the Horologists versus the soul vampires of the Shaded Way. The first narrative follows Holly Sykes as a child running away from home, the second jumps to Hugo Lamb, an overly-smart Cambridge student on a vacation to the Swiss Alps and who dalliances with Holly Sykes. The third narrative follows Ed Brubeck, husband to Holly Sykes and foreign war reporter caught between his love of family and his compulsion to live life on the edge. After Brubeck, we get fading author Crispin Hershey, a facsimile of Martin Amix, David Mitchell, and perhaps Salman Rushdie, as his career hurdles towards oblivion. Again, his narrative hinges on Holly, as they develop a friendship after Holly has published her book _Radio People_ to great acclaim. In the penultimate narrative, we occupy Marinus's narrative, an ancient atemporal currently living in the body of a psychiatrist, as she and her fellow atemporals gear up for the final showdown with the soul vampires. In the last narrative, we return to an elderly Holly Sykes as the world has descended into climate crisis and on the cusp of regression back to the Stone Ages.

## How was the book
---
Most people have rendered some version of the following thought after reading more than a few Mitchell novels: is there anything he can't do? The metaphor of atemporals, or souls that transcend bodies and death, "who inherit resurrection as birthright", serves a convenient parallel to the way Mitchell inhabits characters up and down the class register. One chapter he is the daughter of blue collar salt of the earth tavern owners, the next he is sociopathic but "talented" Hugo Lamb, destroying the lives of his friends for his own gain. All throughout, Mitchell paves the narrative with the type of mealful prose that you could eat for life on. It's a particular fascination for me on reading Mitchell to attribute his allure to either style or narrative, since inevitably an author must fall to one side or the other. I vacillate from a deep appreciation in the feng shui of his narrative, the matryoshka-like stories within stories, the neatly nested narrative that propels his character's lives to helix-like intersect each other, to leaning in to the visceral and bodily metaphor: someone has "cheekbones you'd slice your thumb on", or someone's laugh is described as "a sequence of glottal stops, like the noise a body might make as it falls down wooden stairs into a basement". There is something for everyone here. On display is a buffet of genres, of styles, of narratives, of metaphors, of dialogues, of plots.

While most of Mitchell's work defies genre, _The Bone Clocks_ might be said to occupy that rarefied place of literary science fiction, and he has more than a passing similarity to writers like Marukami, Ishiguro, or Rushdie, all of whom have to varying degrees embraced the fantastic in their fiction. _The Bone Clocks_ represents the most concentrated dive for Mitchell into the fantastic, and instead of hinting at the bizarre or fantastic like in _de Zoet_, the novel's depiction of the final battle between Horologist's and Anchorites feels a bit like a Marvel set piece action scene, and a paragraph like this exists:

> Seeing my dead body against the wall, the Anchorites reason that no psychosoteric can now attack them, and their red shield flickers out. They’ll pay for this mistake. Incorporeally, I pour psychovoltage into a neurobolas and kinetic it at our assailants. It smacks into Imhoff and Westhuizen, the Fifth and Seventh Anchorites, respectively, and down they go. Three against seven. I ingress into Arkady to help him repair the shield, which turns a stronger blue and pushes back the remaining Anchorites. When Arkady glances back at Ōshima, however, I see his fight is lost. His body is evaporating as we look. Go to Holly, suborders Arkady. I obey without even thinking to bid him goodbye, an omission I regret even as I transverse to Holly, ingress, evoke an Act of Total Suasion, and … Now what?

Despite this brief departure into action, a turn that might not suit Mitchell's talents as well as other happenings, the denouement of the novel returns to the immensely personal reality of life with irrevocable climate change, to a world on the cusp of becoming a hellscape of barbarism, and returning to Mitchell the reins he is much more capable of wielding: exceptionally well-crafted dialogue, perfect pacing, and a fine eye for the twitches of humanity that enfleshes the characters living on the page.

## Favorite quotes

> A writer flirts with schizophrenia, nurtures synesthesia, and embraces obsessive-compulsive disorder. Your art feeds on you, your soul, and, yes, to a degree, your sanity. Writing novels worth reading will bugger up your mind, jeopardize your relationships, and distend your life. You have been warned. (390)

> I put my hand on the altar rail. “What if … what if heaven is real, but only in moments? Like a glass of water on a hot day when you’re dying of thirst, or when someone’s nice to you for no reason, or …” Mam’s pancakes with Mars Bar sauce; Dad dashing up from the bar just to tell me, “Sleep tight don’t let the bedbugs bite”; or Jacko and Sharon singing “For She’s a Squishy Marshmallow” instead of “For She’s a Jolly Good Fellow” every single birthday and wetting themselves even though it’s not at all funny; and Brendan giving his old record player to me instead of one of his mates. “S’pose heaven’s not like a painting that’s just hanging there forever, but more like … like the best song anyone ever wrote, but a song you only catch in snatches, while you’re alive, from passing cars, or … upstairs windows when you’re lost …” (35)
