</h2>
    
<blockquote>
  <p>We undervalue the “emotional labor” of being the boss” (4)</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Bosses guide a team to achieve results.</strong></p>

<p>Three areas of responsibility for a boss:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
<strong>guidance</strong> - often referred to as <em>feedback</em>
</li>
  <li>
<strong>team-building</strong> - ensure you have a team of rockstars and superstars</li>
  <li>
<strong>results</strong> - teams getting things done</li>
</ol>

</div>

<p>There are two dimensions to Radical Candor:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
<strong>Care Personally</strong>:</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>To have a good relationship, you have to be your whole self and care about each of the people who work for you as a human being. It’s not just business; it is personal, and <em>deeply</em> personal. (9)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are a few things more damaging to human relationships than a sense of superiority. (12)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Only when you actually care about the <em>whole person with your whole self</em> can you build a relationship. (13)</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
  <li>
<strong>Challenge Directly</strong>:</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>[…] delivering hard feedback, making hard calls about who does what on a team, and holding a high bar for results (9)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You don’t need to say every unimportant thing: a good rule of thumb is to leave three unimportant things unsaid each day (16)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Radical Candor] gets measured at the listener’s ear, not at the speaker’s mouth. (16)</p>

</h3>
    
<p>If you criticize someone without showing you care, it feels obnoxiously aggressive to the recipient. If you can’t be radically candid with someone, you can at least be obnoxiously aggressive, so at least people know where you stand. Most people prefer the challenging “jerk” to the boss whose “niceness” gets in the way of candor.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s not mean, it’s clear! (25)</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>front-stabbing</strong> - belittling in public.</li>
  <li>
<strong>belittling compliments</strong> - praise that is belittling</li>
</ul>

</h3>
    
<p>What happens when you don’t care enough about a person to challenge directly. Normally results in empty praise and ignoring of problems, or even praise of problems.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>false apology</strong> - agreeing with a person just to remove tension</li>
</ul>

</h3>
    
<p>Responsible for the vast majority of managerial mistakes. An effort to avoid tension and discomfort.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>just trying to say something nice</strong> - trying to find an excuse to give praise when praise might need to be distributed or might not be merited.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>when giving praise, investigate until you really understand who did what and why it was so great. Be as specific and thorough with praise as with criticism. Go deep into the details. (33)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>If a person is bold enough to criticize you, do <em>not</em> critique their criticism. If you see somebody criticize a peer inappropriately, say something. But if somebody criticizes <em>you</em> inappropriately, it’s your job is to listen with the intent to understand and then reward the candor. (34)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Balance praise and criticism – worry more about praise, less about criticism, but above all be sincere.</p>

</h2>
    

<p>Teams are made up of rockstars and superstars. Rockstars want to excel in their niche while superstars need new challenges and opportunities to grow constantly.</p>

<div class="table-wrapper"><table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>steep growth trajectory</th>
      <th>gradual growth trajectory</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>change agent</td>
      <td>force for stability</td>

    <tr>
      <td>ambitious at work</td>
      <td>ambitious outside of work or simply content in life</td>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>“superstar”</td>
      <td>“rockstar”</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table></div>

<p>shift from talent management to growth management, with “growth” substituting for “potential”, as “low potential” demonizes the rockstars who are essential for stability.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The most important thing you can do for your team collectively is to understand what growth trajectory each person wants to be on at a given time and whether that matches the needs and opportunities of the team. (48)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Growth Trajectory:</p>

<p>The idea of getting people who are “passionate” for their jobs is misguided, as people are motivated for different reasons.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[…] your job is not to provide purpose but instead to get to know each of your direct reports well enough to understand how each on derives meaning from their work. (51)</p>

<p>For these individuals, you should part ways. Managers typically wait too long to fire someone, so you can ask three questions to determine if the time is right to fire someone:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
<em>Have you given Radically Candid guidance?</em> - have you been humble and direct in your criticism?</li>
  <li>
<em>How is this person’s poor performance affecting the rest of the team?</em> - does it affect peers?</li>
  <li>
<em>Have you sought out a second opinion, spoken to someone whom you trust and with whom you can talk the problem through?</em> - seek a different perspective</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Common lies managers tell themselves to avoid firing someone</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li><em>It will get better</em></li>
  <li><em>Somebody is better than nobody</em></li>
  <li><em>A transfer is the answer</em></li>
  <li><em>It’s bad for morale</em></li>
</ol>

<p>When firing someone, it might help to recall a job you were not well suited for and the relief you experienced when you no longer had to do that job.</p>

<p>Ensure that everyone is heard; give the quiet ones a voice.</p>

<p><strong>quiet listening</strong> - not giving your opinion vehemently; comfortable with the silences
<strong>loud listening</strong> - put a strong view on things but insist on a response; “strong opinions, weakly held”</p>

<p>You want to create a culture of listening:</p>
<ol>
  <li>have a simple system for employees to use to generate ideas and voice complaints</li>
  <li>make sure that at least some of the issues raised are quickly addressed</li>

<p>The point of spending all the time in clarifying mode is to get an idea ready for debate (the rock tumbler of ideas). You need to ensure there is a culture of debate on the team.</p>

<p>Keep the conversation focused on ideas, not egos. Egos have a way of corrupting ideas and argument, twisting it to <em>ad hominem</em>.</p>

<p>Also, important for folks to dissent, not just all agree.</p>

<p>Use humor and have fun.</p>

<p>One of the most important aspects is relinquishing unilateral authority so you can build trusting relationships. This isn’t abdication or anarchy, but rather, building a relationship based on trust so people feel free at work.</p>

<p>A helpful question might be “What could I do or stop doing that would make it easier to work with me”</p>

<p>Embrace the discomfort, and listen with the intent to understand, not to respond. You can try saying “So What I hear you saying is…”</p>

<p>Be humble – a helpful paradigm can be the <strong>situation</strong>, <strong>behavior</strong>, <strong>impact</strong>. Outline a <strong>situation</strong>, describe the <strong>behavior</strong>, good or bad, and identify the <strong>impact</strong>. e.g., “I’ve been waiting for that spot for five minutes (situation) and you just zipped in front of me (behavior) and now I’m going to be late (impact).</p>

<p>Separate what you think from what you said, and see if what you thought impinged on what you said.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ontological Humility - separate subjective experience from objective reality</li>
  <li>be helpful</li>
  <li>state intentions to lower defenses</li>
  <li>show, don’t tell</li>
  <li>finding help is better than offering it yourself</li>
  <li>guidance is a gift, not a whip or a carrot</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, you should try and give feedback immediately, before it is lost in the haze of time when you might forget the situation or behavior. If you can, say it in person (perhaps between meetings). Don’t save it up for performance reviews, or for the perfect opportunity.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Praise in public, criticize in private. (145)</p>

<p>Might be harder for men managing women, as there is a punches pulled effect. Gender politics might also get in the way of honest and open communication.</p>

<p>Radical candor might be harder for women; might be construed as ‘abrasive’ or ‘shrill’, or as a ‘likeability’ concern.</p>

<p>For men, don’t pull punches.</p>

<p>For women, demand criticism.</p>

<p>For men and women, when you think a women is being ‘too aggressive’:</p>
<ul>
  <li>switch gender roles</li>
  <li>be more specific</li>
  <li>don’t use gendered language</li>
  <li>never just say ‘be more likeable’</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are a women who is told you are abrasive:</p>
<ul>
  <li>never stop challenging directly (often, women back off, which harms their careers)</li>
  <li>care personally, but kill the “angel in the office” (paving over the gap with doing office chores”)</li>
  <li>the competence/likeability has not concluded that you weren’t out of line</li>
  <li>don’t kick up and kiss down</li>
  <li>don’t write men off</li>
</ul>

<p>Skip level meetings are a good way to understand how your direct reports are managing. You set up a meeting with your direct reports direct reports to understand how they might be managing, to solicit honest feedback.</p>

<strong>Show up!</strong> You’re only going to have seven or eight of these per quarter, so DO NOT CANCEL.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Your direct report’s agenda, not yours</strong> This way, you are listening to what matters to them.  Set some basic expectations for how they deliver the agenda – night before, written out, or not written out at all. (Realistically, will you look at it if you have them send it to you the day before?)</li>
  <li>
<strong>Ask good follow-up questions</strong> Show that you’re really interested, but don’t become a micromanager.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Encourage new ideas in the 1:1</strong>  New ideas are fragile, so invite these ideas so you might help them clarify their thinking and understanding before communicating these ideas to others.</li>

</h4>
    
<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Cancellations</strong> This is a sign your partnership isn’t that meaningful, or that you’ve been using the meeting inappropriately.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Updates</strong> Don’t waste this time letting people give updates that could be emailed to you.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Good news only</strong> This is a sign people don’t feel comfortable coming to you with their problems or think you can’t help.  Specifically ask for bad news.</li>
  <li>
<strong>No criticism</strong> If they don’t criticize you, beware.</li>
  <li>
<strong>No agenda</strong> If they keep forgetting to have an agenda, they may be overwhelmed, or may not understand the purpose of the meeting, or they may not think it’s useful at all. Be direct but polite when addressing this.</li>

</h3>
    
<p>An effective staff meeting has three goals: it reviews how things have gone the previous week, allows people to share important updates, and forces the team to clarify the most important decisions and debates for the coming week. Here’s a sample agenda:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Learn</strong>: review key metrics (twenty minutes)
    <ul>
      <li>What went well this week and why?  What went badly?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
<strong>Listen</strong>: put updates in a shared document (fifteen minutes)
    <ul>
      <li>Keep everyone aware of what’s going on so they’re not blindsided and won’t do work someone else is already doing.</li>
      <li>Study hall snippets: give 5-7 minutes at the beginning of the meeting for everyone to write down what they’re working on, then 5-7 minutes to pass it around.  This will save you time in the long run.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
<strong>Clarify</strong>: identify key decisions and debates (thirty minutes)
    <ul>
      <li>Remember to separate big debate meetings and big decision meetings, and identify owners for each of these.  Identify a group of people who have to be there, but ideally anyone who wants to attend them should be free to.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

</h3>
    
<p>Block some time on your calendar just to think every day, and don’t cancel this time for anything!  If you don’t do this, the only time you will have to clarify your thinking is at home when you should be sleeping. Hold this blocked think time sacred and get really, seriously angry if anyone tries to schedule over it.  Encourage your team to do the same.</p>

</h3>
    

<p>Make it clear that you’re debating, not deciding!  There are three purposes of these meetings:</p>
<ol>
  <li>They lower tension.
    <ul>
      <li>Self-organizing criticality: a lot of little corrections create stability but one huge correction creates catastrophe.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>They allow you to slow down key decisions when appropriate.</li>
  <li>They foster a larger culture of debate.</li>
</ol>

<p>Ask your team to switch roles halfway through the debate, which makes sure people are listening to each other and trying to come up with the best solution.</p>

</h3>
    
<p>Make very clear to your team that the decisions of this meeting are FINAL, otherwise they’ll just keep appealing them and debating into perpetuity. Feel free to either attend the meeting or let the decider know you have veto power – use it VERY sparingly.</p>

  <li>Careful summary of the meeting distributed to all relevant parties</li>
</ul>

<p>All-Hands Meeting Now that a decision has been made by the relevant parties, it’s time to bring others along.  These meetings have two parts:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Presentation
    <ol>
      <li>To persuade people the company is making good decisions and headed in the right direction</li>
      <li>Focus on one or two initiatives</li>
      <li>These are given by the team working on the initiative, not the boss</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Q&amp;A
    <ol>
      <li>This allows leaders to hear dissent and address it head-on. The answers to these questions are usually more persuasive than the presentations.</li>
      <li>This portion should be handled by the CEO/founders. There is a real power in explaining important decisions and encouraging dissent.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>

<p>Be absolutely ruthless about making sure your team has time to execute.  Encourage them to block execution time just like they would block think time.</p>

</h3>
    
<p>This is a great way to create a visible workflow so nothing falls through the cracks.  It’s a board with three columns: To Do, In Progress, and Done.  Then, buy a bunch of post-its and assign each person a color.  They can then put their tasks and move them around on the board, which will help you see who is really driving results and who’s just along for the ride.</p>

</h3>
    
<p>Spend time with the people on your team simply by walking around and asking what they’re working on.  This is a great way to connect with the whole company, not just your direct reports.  You’re going to notice things you wouldn’t have otherwise noticed:</p>
<ul>
  <li>They’ll help you find the devil in the details.  You don’t want to be the last person to know when there’s an issue.</li>
  <li>Being aware of these problems allows you to roll up your sleeves and fix them, squashing the “that’s beneath me” mentality bosses often get.</li>
</ul>
