## three stages of company
- startup - a company that has yet to achieve _market fit_
- growth-stage - companies that are concerned with how to effectively grow and scale
- enterprise - companies that want to create a lasting business, through both value capture (tweaking and optimizing current products) and developing products to reach their full potential

## root causes of failed product efforts

- many companies operate like above, leading to lack of innovation and very long turn times to get into customer hands
- the engineering teams might be agile, but everything else is waterfall
- this leads to 10 big problems:
1. **source of ideas** - sales or stakeholder driven rather than engineers, who are often best source of ideas but just become mercenaries
2. **business cases** - while often a good thing for big projects, expecting to know _how much a product will make_ and _how long it will take to implement_ is impossible at this stage
3. **product roadmaps** - just a list of features and ignores the two inconvenient truths of product
4. **role of product management** - in this model, it is just requirements gathering and documenting for engineers
5. **design too late** - lipstick on a pig for design to be brought in so late
6. **engineering brought in too late**
7. **agile too late**
8. **project-centered work** - projects are about output, and product is about outcomes
9. **customer validation happens too late**
10. **opportunity cost** - what could we have been working on instead?

### two inconvenient truths about product
1. at least half our ideas are just not going to work
2. for the ideas that have potential, it will take several iterations to deliver value (time to money)

## three overarching principles of product
1. risks are tackled up front rather than at the end
2. products are defined and designed collaboratively rather than sequentially
3. it's about solving problems, not implementing features

## key concepts
- **holistic product** - a products functionality, technology, user experience design, how we monetize it, how we acquire and attract users and customers, and it's offline experiences
- **continuous discovery and delivery** - need to discover product to be built and deliver it to market

### product discovery
- output of product discovery is a _validated product backlog_
- answers the questions:
    1. will the user buy this?
    2. can the user figure out how to use this?
    3. can our engineers build this?
    4. can our stakeholders support this

### prototypes
- a series of quick and inexpensive experiments to prove product viability, feasibility
- strong teams test many product ideas per week, typically 10-20

### product delivery
- bringing a product to market, including necessary scale, performance, reliability, fault tolerance, security, privacy, internationalization, etc.

### product/market fit
- smallest possible actual product that meets the specific needs of a specific market of customers
- MVP is not a product, MVP is a prototype!

### product vision
- long-term objective of a product, typically 2-10 years out

#### principles of product vision
1. start with why
2. fall in love with the problem, not the solution
3. don't be afraid to think big with vision
4. don't be afraid to disrupt yourself because, if you don't, someone else will
5. the product vision needs to inspire
6. determine and embrace relevant and meaningful trends
7. skate to where the puck is heading, not to where it was
8. be stubborn on vision, flexible on the details
9. realize that any product vision is a leap of faith
10. evangelize continuously and relentlessly

### product strategy
- the sequence of products or releases we plan to deliver on the path to realizing the product vision
- should be focused, whereas product vision should be inspiring

#### principles of product strategy
1. focus on one target market or persona at a time
2. product strategy needs to be aligned with business strategy
3. product strategy needs to be aligned with sales and go-to-market strategy
4. obsess over customers, not over competitors
5. communicate the strategy across the organization

### product evangelism
1. use a prototype
2. share the pain
3. share the vision
4. share learnings generously
5. share credit generously
6. learn how to give a great demo
7. do your homework
8. be genuinely excited
9. learn to show some enthusiasm
10. spend time with your team

## product discovery
- the purpose of discovery is to address these risks:
1. **value risk** - will the customer buy this, or choose to use it
2. **usability risk** - can the user figure out how to use it
3. **feasibility risk** - can we build it
4. **business viability risk** - does this solution work for our business

### principles
1. we know we can't count on customers to tell us what to build
2. the most important thing is to establish compelling value
3. as hard and important as engineering is, coming up with a good user experience is usually even harder, and more critical to success
4. functionality, design, and technology are inherently intertwined
5. we expect that many of our ideas won't work out, and the ones that do require several iterations
6. we must validate our ideas on real users and customers
7. our goal in discovery is to validate our ideas the fastest, cheapest way possible
8. we need to validate the feasibility of our ideas during discovery, not after
9. we need to validate the business viability of our ideas during discovery, not after
10. it's about shared learning

### discovery techniques
#### discovery framing
- allows us to quickly tackle the underlying issues that must be tackled during product discovery
- **opportunity assessment** - answer four key questions about discovery work -- objective, key result, customer problem, and target market
- **customer letter** - originally like the amazon press release, but imagine you are a customer pleased with the solution, and write a letter to show that satisfaction
- **startup canvas** - useful for completely new products

#### discovery planning
- help identify the bigger challenges and planning how to attack this work
- **story map** - arrange user stories into mapping of functionality -- useful for narrative of the work
- **customer discovery program** - getting _reference customers_ (real customer, running product in production, paying real money, and willing to tell others) -- often these reference customers are the single best indicator of future product success

#### discovery ideation
- designed to provide the product team with a wealth of promising solutions aimed at current problems
- **customer interviews**
- **concierge test** - do the customers job for them to get a feel for what it's like
- **customer misbehavior** - monitor what the customer _wants_ to do outside of typical behavior
- **hcak days** - either directed or undirected, but useful for developer ideas

#### discovery prototyping
- many different forms of prototypes, different characteristics suited for different things
- **feasibility** - testing technical feasibility of a solution
- **user** - simulation of user interaction, with varying degrees of _fidelity_ (closeness to reality) -- useful to assess how a user interacts
- **live-data** - main use case is to collect actual data to prove something
- **hybrid** - some combination of the above

main principles
1. to learn something at a much lower cost in terms of time and effort than building a product
2. force you to think through a problem at a substantially deeper level tha nif we just about it or write it out
3. a powerful tool for team collaboration
4. many different possibilities for fidelity for a prototype
5. the primary purpose of a prototype is to tackle one or more product risks

#### discovery testing
