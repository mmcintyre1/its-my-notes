## three stages of company
- startup - a company that has yet to achieve _market fit_
- growth-stage - companies that are concerned with how to effectively grow and scale
- enterprise - companies that want to create a lasting business, through both value capture (tweaking and optimizing current products) and developing products to reach their full potential

## root causes of failed product efforts

- many companies operate like above, leading to lack of innovation and very long turn times to get into customer hands
- the engineering teams might be agile, but everything else is waterfall
- this leads to 10 big problems:
1. **source of ideas** - sales or stakeholder driven rather than engineers, who are often best source of ideas but just become mercenaries
2. **business cases** - while often a good thing for big projects, expecting to know _how much a product will make_ and _how long it will take to implement_ is impossible at this stage
3. **product roadmaps** - just a list of features and ignores the two inconvenient truths of product
4. **role of product management** - in this model, it is just requirements gathering and documenting for engineers
5. **design too late** - lipstick on a pig for design to be brought in so late
6. **engineering brought in too late**
7. **agile too late**
8. **project-centered work** - projects are about output, and product is about outcomes
9. **customer validation happens too late**
10. **opportunity cost** - what could we have been working on instead?

### two inconvenient truths about product
1. at least half our ideas are just not going to work
2. for the ideas that have potential, it will take several iterations to deliver value (time to money)

## three overarching principles of product
1. risks are tackled up front rather than at the end
2. products are defined and designed collaboratively rather than sequentially
3. it's about solving problems, not implementing features

## key concepts
- **holistic product** - a products functionality, technology, user experience design, how we monetize it, how we acquire and attract users and customers, and it's offline experiences
- **continuous discovery and delivery** - need to discover product to be built and deliver it to market

### product discovery
- output of product discovery is a _validated product backlog_
- answers the questions:
    1. will the user buy this?
    2. can the user figure out how to use this?
    3. can our engineers build this?
    4. can our stakeholders support this

### prototypes
- a series of quick and inexpensive experiments to prove product viability, feasibility
- strong teams test many product ideas per week, typically 10-20

### product delivery
- bringing a product to market, including necessary scale, performance, reliability, fault tolerance, security, privacy, internationalization, etc.

### product/market fit
- smallest possible actual product that meets the specific needs of a specific market of customers
- MVP is not a product, MVP is a prototype!

### product vision
- long-term objective of a product, typically 2-10 years out
