# Effortless: Make It Easier To Do What Matters Most

| : EFFORTLESS STATE :|||
|-|-|
| Effortless State | The Effortless State is an experience many of us have had when we are physically rested, emotionally unburdened, and mentally energized. You are completely aware, alert, present, attentive, and focused on what’s important in this moment.

| : EFFORTLESS ACTION :|||
|-|-|
| Effortless Action | Effortless Action means accomplishing more by trying less. You stop procrastinating and take the first obvious step. You arrive at the point of completion without overthinking. You make progress by pacing yourself rather than powering through. You overachieve without overexerting.                                                     |
| DEFINE            | <ul><li>To get started on an essential project, first define what “done” looks like.</li> <li>Establish clear conditions for completion, get there, then stop.</li> <li>Take sixty seconds to focus on your desired outcome.</li> <li>Write a “Done for the Day” list. Limit it to items that would constitute meaningful progress.</li></ul> |
| START             | <ul>Make the first action the most obvious one. Break the first obvious action down into the tiniest, concrete step. Then name it.

| SIMPLIFY          | <ul><li>To simplify the process, don’t simplify the steps: simply remove them.</li><li>Recognize that not everything requires you to go the extra mile.</li><li>Maximize the steps not taken.</li><li>Measure progress in the tiniest of increments.</li></ul>                                                                                |
| PROGRESS          | <ul><li>When you start a project, start with rubbish.</li><li>Adopt a “zero-draft” approach and just put some words, any words, on the page.</li><li>Fail cheaply: make learning-sized mistakes.</li><li>Protect your progress from the harsh critic in your head.</li></ul>                                                                  |

| : EFFORTLESS RESULTS :|||
|-|-|
| Effortless Results | You’ve continued to cultivate your Effortless State. You’ve started to take Effortless Action with clarity of objective, tiny, obvious first steps, and a consistent pace.

## Two Key Takeaways
1. Instead of asking why something is hard, ask why can't it be easy -- invert the question. First devised by Carl Jacobi, who said, _man muss immer umkehren_, which translates to “One must invert, always invert.”
2. Need to resist the puritanical idea that effort is equated with value -- not everything worthwhile is hard, and not everything easy is valueless. Start from first principles, state the problem clearly, and work towards the lightest lift you can to solve the problem. More effort spent on solving a problem doesn't drive more value.

## Brief Thoughts
Rating: 5/10

Your mileage may vary depending on how similar you think achieving hard business outcomes is to free throw shooting. McKeown moves adjectivally from his first book, from _Essentialism_ to _Effortless_ (one could imagine the -ness was dropped in some editing room with a hard-and-fast rule dictating that single word titles can't exceed 3 syllables or 3 _s_es). McKeown outlines three stages of achieving this effortlessness, from effortless state to effortless actions to effortless results. There is some valuable, although commonsensical, advice (get enough sleep, be an active listener) interspersed with some Fletcherism (essential work broken down to three sessions of no more than 90 minutes, don't do more today than you can recover from today, clear physical clutter to clear mental clutter). McKeown also claims to leverage cognitive research to validate his theories, and while there are passing references to things like perceptual load theory or the cognitive ease principle, this book is not about the research. It's a fast read and if nothing else is valuable for the idea of inverting hard problems to ask what they would look like if they were easy. That, and we should all be taking more _effortless_ naps.
