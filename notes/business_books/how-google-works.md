# How Google Works
## Some Tidbits
### Attraction-Selection-Attrition Model
- models the emergence of organizational characteristics as three processes that reflect a member's decisions to join (attract), remain in (selection), and ultimately leave (attrition) an organization

### smart creatives

### Horseback Law
- many things don't require you to dismount your horse, i.e., jump in and do a detailed analysis. It's enough to mosey on up and quickly check things then move on

### Habitually Overcommunicate
- Focus on the following:
    1. does the communication reinfroce core themes that you want everyone to get
    2. is the communication effective
    3. is the communication interesting, fun, or inspirational
    4. is the communication authentic
    5. is the communication going to the right people
    6. are you using the right media
    7. tell the truth, be humble, and bank goodwill for a rainy day

### 70/20/10
- 70% of projects related to core business
- 20% to emerging products that had achieved some success
- 10% for completely new things that have high risk of failure

### 20% time
- different than 70/20/10, which covers operational time
- this is more conceptual, where employees have a 20% dedicated bandwidth to work on completely speculative projects
- examples are gmail
- failure is OK as long as you learn

### Other kernels
- Spend 80 percent of your time on 80 percent of your revenue
- every meeting needs an owner

## Thoughts
Google is perhaps the most successful business of the last 50 years, and the things they needed to do to scale as quickly as they needed to might not be applicable to everyone else. The Google brand allows for a certain approach that other, less innovative companies just can't get away with. I wonder how much of what Google can do is because of their absurd margins and revenue numbers. They can overcome sunk cost much more easily because their bottom line is so enormous.
