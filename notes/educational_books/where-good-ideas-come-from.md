# Where Good Ideas Come From

## Notes
**the adjacent possible**
> Adjacent, i.e., nearby, possibilities constantly emerge in a multitude of settings for a multitude of entities. When these possibilities are explored, yet new possibilities emerge. The concept of the “adjacent possible” was introduced by Stuart Kauffman (1996; 2000) in evolutionary biology and complex adaptive systems to explain how biological evolution can be seen as exploration and actualization of what is adjacent possible, i.e., available at hand. The concept has now disseminated into a wide range of research fields including economy, innovation studies, technological evolution, cultural evolution, learning processes, recommender systems, and design studies.

> The “adjacent possible” can be defined as “the set of possibilities available to individuals, communities, institutions, organisms, productive processes, etc., at a given point in time during their evolution” (Loreto 2015, p. 9). The concept of the “adjacent possible” is useful for understanding how new possibilities emerge, and how they are constrained, discovered, explored, actualized, developed, reconfigured, designed, and so on, in an interplay between what is actual and what is possible for specific entities in specific settings.

**common-place book**
- book where you put everything you've read and thought, and you use this to synthesize new ideas, forcing serendipity
- common in the 18th and 19th century -- e.g. Darwin and others

## Thoughts
fascinated by where ideas come from. you look at some of the greatest inventions or breakthroughs in the last 100 years, they seem to come out of these melting pots: bletchly park, or bell labs, or building 20 at MIT, or Los Alamos and the Manhattan Project, or the Tech Model Railroad Club at MIT. They all follow a similar pattern, stick a bunch of really smart interdisciplinary people in a place and let them think about stuff. maybe im a hegelian on this -- any progress comes from conflict, either with other ideas or you from the past. I need to write and off-board my thoughts more often. the self isn't a continuity despite feeling like it, and I can't be forced to directly reckon with my past thinking unless I persist it in some external repository. Then, past me can be the thesis to present me's antithesis, and build a new synthesis.
