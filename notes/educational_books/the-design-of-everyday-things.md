# The Design of Everyday Things

## 1: The Psychopathology of Everday Things
**norman doors** - poorly designed doors where it isn't clear if you should push or pull

**two most important parts of design**
1. _discoverability_ - is it even possible to figure out what actions are possible and where and how to perform them?
2. _understanding_ - what does it all mean? how is the product supposed to be used? what do all the different controls and settings mean?

> All artificial things are designed (4)

**three types of design**
1. _industrial design_ - The professional service of creating and developing concepts and specifications that optimize the function, value, and appearance of products and systems for mutual benefit of both user and manufacturer
2. _interactive design_ - The focus is upon how people interact with technology. The goal is to enhance people's understanding of what can be done, what ishappening, and what has just occurred. Interaction design draws upon principles of psychology, design, art, and emotion to ensure a positive, enjoyable experience.
3. _experience design_ - The practice of designing products, processes, services, events, and environments with a focus placed on the quality and enjoyment of the total experience

> It is the duty of machines and those who design them to understand people [...] We have to accept human behavior the way it is, not the way that we would wish it to be. (6)

**human-centered design**
- a design philosophy that puts human needs, capabilities, and behavior first, then designs to accommodate those needs, capabilities, and ways of behaving

> Great designers produce pleasurable experiences. (10)

**fundamental principles of interaction**
1. _affordances_
    - the relationship between the properties of an object and the capabilities of the agent that determine how the object could be used
    - e.g., a chair affords sitting, but a heavy chair might only afford lifting to a few
    - importantly, it is not a property but a relationship -- key is knowing who will use what you design
2. _signifiers_
    - refers to any mark or sound, any perceivable indicator that communicates the appropriate behavior to a person
    - affordances determine what actions are possible, signifiers communicate where the action should take place
    - more important than affordances because they communicate how to use the design
3. _mappings_
    - the relationship between the elements of two sets of things
    - e.g., a set of light switches and the lights they control, or the controls that move a car seat
    - related controls should be grouped together, controls should be close to the item being controlled
4. _feedback_
    - some way of letting you know the system is working on your request
    - must be immediate
    - must be informative
5. _conceptual model_
    - an explanation, usually highly simplified, of how something works
    - depending on your expertise, your conceptual model might be more or less right

**system image**
- the combined information available to us
- informed by the designer's conceptual model, and informs the user's conceptual model

**the paradox of technology**
> The same technology that simplifies life by providing more functions in each device also complicates life by making the device harder to learn, harder to use. (34)
