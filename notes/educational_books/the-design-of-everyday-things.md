# The Design of Everyday Things

## 1: The Psychopathology of Everyday Things

### Key Chapter Takeaways
Every object has certain abilities (affordances) that object allows dependent upon the user of that object. There are ways to signal what those abilities are (signifiers), and how to create those is the key insight of designing. We should design for humans through human-centered design, without the rosy-colored idea that humans are perfect agents and should bend to the machines contours rather than the other way around.

**norman doors** - poorly designed doors where it isn't clear if you should push or pull

**two most important parts of design**
1. _discoverability_ - is it even possible to figure out what actions are possible and where and how to perform them?
2. _understanding_ - what does it all mean? how is the product supposed to be used? what do all the different controls and settings mean?

> All artificial things are designed (4)

### Three Types of Design
1. _industrial design_ - The professional service of creating and developing concepts and specifications that optimize the function, value, and appearance of products and systems for mutual benefit of both user and manufacturer
2. _interactive design_ - The focus is upon how people interact with technology. The goal is to enhance people's understanding of what can be done, what ishappening, and what has just occurred. Interaction design draws upon principles of psychology, design, art, and emotion to ensure a positive, enjoyable experience.
3. _experience design_ - The practice of designing products, processes, services, events, and environments with a focus placed on the quality and enjoyment of the total experience

> It is the duty of machines and those who design them to understand people [...] We have to accept human behavior the way it is, not the way that we would wish it to be. (6)

### Human-Centered Design
- a design philosophy that puts human needs, capabilities, and behavior first, then designs to accommodate those needs, capabilities, and ways of behaving

> Great designers produce pleasurable experiences. (10)

### Fundamental Principles of Design
1. _discoverability_ - It is possible to determine what actions are possible and the current state of the device
2. _affordances_ - The proper affordances exist to make the desired action possible
    - the relationship between the properties of an object and the capabilities of the agent that determine how the object could be used
    - e.g., a chair affords sitting, but a heavy chair might only afford lifting to a few
    - importantly, it is not a property but a relationship -- key is knowing who will use what you design
    - are the possible interactions between people and the environment -- some are perceivable, some are not
    - perceived affordances often act as signifiers, but they can be ambiguous
3. _signifiers_ - Effective use of signifier ensures discoverability, and that the feedback is well communicated and intelligible
    - refers to any mark or sound, any perceivable indicator that communicates the appropriate behavior to a person
    - affordances determine what actions are possible, signifiers communicate where the action should take place
    - more important than affordances because they communicate how to use the design
    - must be perceivable, otherwise they fail to function
4. _constraints_ - Providing physical, logical, semantic, and cultural constraints guides actions and eases interpretations
5. _mappings_ - The relationship between controls and their actions follows the principles of good mapping, enhanced as much as possible through spatial layout and temporal contiguity
    - the relationship between the elements of two sets of things
    - e.g., a set of light switches and the lights they control, or the controls that move a car seat
    - related controls should be grouped together, controls should be close to the item being controlled
6. _feedback_ - There is full and continuous information about the results of actions and the current state of the product or service. After an action has been executed, it is easy to determine the new state.
    - some way of letting you know the system is working on your request
    - must be immediate
    - must be informative
7. _conceptual model_ - The design projects all the information needed to create a good conceptual model of the system, leading to understanding and a feeling of control. The conceptual model enhances both discoverability and evaluation of results
    - an explanation, usually highly simplified, of how something works
    - depending on your expertise, your conceptual model might be more or less right

**system image**
- the combined information available to us
- informed by the designer's conceptual model, and informs the user's conceptual model

**the paradox of technology**
> The same technology that simplifies life by providing more functions in each device also complicates life by making the device harder to learn, harder to use. (34)

## 2: The Psychology of Everyday Actions

### Key Chapter Takeaways
In addition to the affordances and signifiers of any given object, there is also the way humans interact with the object. There are three interaction modes, from the visceral to the behavioral to the reflective, and these follow along cognitive models of fast and slow thinking. Key to designing is understanding how cognition and emotion factor into the way people interact with objects.

### Two Gulfs of Action
1. _Gulf of Execution_ - where people try to figure out how it operates
2. _Gulf of Evaluation_ - where they try and figure out what happened

### Seven Stages of Action
1. Goal (form the goal) - _What do I want to accomplish?_
2. Plan (the action) - _What are teh alternative action sequences?_
3. Specify (an action sequence) - _What action can I do now?_
4. Perform (the action sequence) - _How do I do it?_
5. Perceive (the state of the world) - _What happened?_
6. Interpret (the perception) - _What does it mean?_
7. Compare (the outcome with the goal) - _Is this okay? Have I accomplished my goal?_

> For many everyday tasks, goals and intentions are not well specified: they are opportunistic rather than planned. Opportunistic actions are those in which the behavior takes advantage of circumstances. (43)

- people don't want a quarter-inch drill, they want a quarter-inch hole -- but really they want to hang a picture, and they want their house to feel welcoming, or they want to do what others do to make their house welcoming

> we like to think we understand ourselves. But the truth is, we don't. Most of human behavior is a result of subconscious processes. (44)

**two types of memory**
1. declarative memory -- for factual information
2. procedural memory -- recalling activities performed

### Three Levels of Processing
a conceptual model not to be taken too literally, but helpful grounding framework for thinking about what a designer needs to think about when designing
1. **visceral**
    - basic protective mechanism of the human affective system
    - quick judgments based on environment
    - fast and completely subconscious
    - _great designers use aesthetic sensibilities to drive visceral responses_
2. **behavioral**
    - learned skills, triggered by situations that match appropriate patterns
    - _for designers, most critical aspect is that every action is associated with an expectation_
3. **reflective**
    - home of conscious cognition
    - where deep understanding develops, where reasoning and conscious decision-making take place
    - _most important for designer, because memories last far longer than the immediate experience_

### learned helplessness
- a situation where people experience repeated failures at a task, and they decide the task can't be done -- can be overcome with _positive psychology_
- we need to remove _failure_ from our vocabulary -- every failure is a learning opportunity

> human error is usually a result of poor design: it should be called system error. (66)

> It is easy to design devices that work well when everything goes as planned. The hard and necessary part of design is to make things work well even when things do not go as planned. (68)

## 3: Knowledge in the Head and in the World

### Key Chapter Takeaways
We don't need the entirety of knowledge of how to precisely use something entirely within our head -- it is a combination of knowledge in our head and in the world that we can gather. Memory in the head takes several different forms and serves several different purposes. Understanding how memory works, how short-term and long-term memory differ, and how we can build constraints and cues into the world to overcome shortcomings with memory, is key to successful design.

### Knowledge in the Head vs Knowledge in the World

| knowledge in the world                                                                                                                                                                             | knowledge in the head                                                                                                                                                                                |

| information is readily and easily available whenever perceivable                                                                                                                                   | marterial in morking memory is readily available. otherwise, considerable search and effort may be required                                                                                          |
| interpretation substitutes for learning. How easy it is to interpret knowledge in the world depends upon the skills of the designer                                                                | Requires learning, which can be considerable. Learning is made easier if there is meaning or structure to the material or if there is a good conceptual model                                        |
| Slowed by the need to find and interpret the knowledge.                                                                                                                                            | Can be efficient, especially if so well-learned that it is automated                                                                                                                                 |
| Ease of use at first encounter is high                                                                                                                                                             | Ease of use at first encounter is low                                                                                                                                                                |
| Can be ugly and inelegant, especially if there is a need to maintain a lot of knowledge. This can lead to clutter. Here is where the skill of the graphics and industrial planner play major roles | Nothing needs to be visible, which gives more freedom to the designer. This leads to cleaner, more pleasing appearance -- at the cost of ease of use at first encounter, learning, and remembering.  |

### The Structure of Memory
1. short-term memory
    - retains most recent experiences and material
    - is fragile
    - design implications: 1) don't count on STM retaining much, 2) use multiple sensory modalities (sight, sound, haptics, hearing, spatial locations, gestures) to deliver different information
2. long-term memory
    - memory for the past
    - not immediately codified, but is through sleep or rehearsal
    - design implications: create approximate models/heuristics to aid in retaining info

> [The] combination of technology and people that creates super-powerful beings. Technology doesn't make us smarter. People do not make technology smart. It is the combination of the two, the person plus the artifact, that is smart. (112)

## 4: Knowing What to Do: Constraints, Discoverability, and Feedback
### Key Chapter Takeaways

### Four Kinds of Constraints
1. **physical** - physical limitations constrain possible operations
2. **cultural** - each culture has a set of allowable actions for social situations that are likely to change with time
3. **semantic** - rely on the meaning of the situation to constrain possible actions
4. **logical** - a relationship between the spatial or functional aspects of a component and the things they control

> A usable design starts with careful observations of how the tasks being supported are actually performed, followed by a design process that results in a good fit to the actual ways the tasks get performed. (137)

### Forcing Functions
> Forcing functions are a form of physical constraint: situations in which the actions are constrained so that failure at one stage prevents the next step from happening. (141)

1. **interlock** - forces operations to take place in a proper sequence, e.g., opening a microwave door and cutting microwave power
2. **lock-in** - keeps an operation active, preventing someone from prematurely stopping it, e.g., jail cells or exit dialogs in word processors or vendor lock-in
3. **lock-out** - prevents someone from entering a space that is dangerous, or prevents an event from occurring, e.g., stairways that have a fire barrier to the basement so people escaping fire don't go all the way to the basement

- **conventions** are a special kind of cultural constraint, but often conventions make it hard to adopt new systems -- change is hard
- use sound as a signifier when vision isn't enough, e.g., the backup warning on trucks
- **skeuomorphic** - the technical term for incorporating old, familiar ideas into new technologies, even though they no longer play a functional role
