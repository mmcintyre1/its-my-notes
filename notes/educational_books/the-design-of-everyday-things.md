# The Design of Everyday Things

## 1: The Psychopathology of Everday Things
**norman doors** - poorly designed doors where it isn't clear if you should push or pull

**two most important parts of design**
1. _discoverability_ - is it even possible to figure out what actions are possible and where and how to perform them?
2. _understanding_ - what does it all mean? how is the product supposed to be used? what do all the different controls and settings mean?

> All artificial things are designed (4)

**three types of design**
1. _industrial design_ - The professional service of creating and developing concepts and specifications that optimize the function, value, and appearance of products and systems for mutual benefit of both user and manufacturer
2. _interactive design_ - The focus is upon how people interact with technology. The goal is to enhance people's understanding of what can be done, what ishappening, and what has just occurred. Interaction design draws upon principles of psychology, design, art, and emotion to ensure a positive, enjoyable experience.
3. _experience design_ - The practice of designing products, processes, services, events, and environments with a focus placed on the quality and enjoyment of the total experience

> It is the duty of machines and those who design them to understand people [...] We have to accept human behavior the way it is, not the way that we would wish it to be. (6)

**human-centered design**
- a design philosophy that puts human needs, capabilities, and behavior first, then designs to accommodate those needs, capabilities, and ways of behaving

> Great designers produce pleasurable experiences. (10)

**fundamental principles of interaction**
1. _discoverability_ - It is possible to determine what actions are possible and the current state of the device
2. _affordances_ - The proper affordances exist to make the desired action possible
    - the relationship between the properties of an object and the capabilities of the agent that determine how the object could be used
    - e.g., a chair affords sitting, but a heavy chair might only afford lifting to a few
    - importantly, it is not a property but a relationship -- key is knowing who will use what you design
    - are the possible interactions between people and the environment -- some are perceivable, some are not
    - perceived affordances often act as signifiers, but they can be ambiguous
3. _signifiers_ - Effective use of signifier ensures discoverability, and that the feedback is well communicated and intelligible
    - refers to any mark or sound, any perceivable indicator that communicates the appropriate behavior to a person
    - affordances determine what actions are possible, signifiers communicate where the action should take place
    - more important than affordances because they communicate how to use the design
    - must be perceivable, otherwise they fail to function
4. _constraints_ - Providing physical, logical, semantic, and cultural constraints guides actions and eases interpretations
5. _mappings_ - The relationship between controls and their actions follows the principles of good mapping, enhanced as much as possible through spatial layout and temporal contiguity
    - the relationship between the elements of two sets of things
    - e.g., a set of light switches and the lights they control, or the controls that move a car seat
    - related controls should be grouped together, controls should be close to the item being controlled
6. _feedback_ - There is full and continuous information about the results of actions and the current state of the product or service. After an action has been executed, it is easy to determine the new state.
    - some way of letting you know the system is working on your request
    - must be immediate
    - must be informative
7. _conceptual model_ - The design projects all the information needed to create a good conceptual model of the system, leading to understanding and a feeling of control. The conceptual model enhances both discoverability and evaluation of results
    - an explanation, usually highly simplified, of how something works
    - depending on your expertise, your conceptual model might be more or less right

**system image**
- the combined information available to us
- informed by the designer's conceptual model, and informs the user's conceptual model

**the paradox of technology**
> The same technology that simplifies life by providing more functions in each device also complicates life by making the device harder to learn, harder to use. (34)

## 2: The Psychology of Everyday Actions
### Two Gulfs of Action
1. _Gulf of Execution_ - where people try to figure out how it operates
2. _Gulf of Evaluation_ - where they try and figure out what happened

### Seven Stages of Action
1. Goal (form the goal) - _What do I want to accomplish?_
2. Plan (the action) - _What are teh alternative action sequences?_
3. Specify (an action sequence) - _What action can I do now?_
4. Perform (the action sequence) - _How do I do it?_
5. Perceive (the state of the world) - _What happened?_
6. Interpret (the perception) - _What does it mean?_
7. Compare (the outcome with the goal) - _Is this okay? Have I accomplished my goal?_

> For many everyday tasks, goals and intentions are not well specified: they are opportunistic rather than planned. Opportunistic actions are those in which the behavior takes advantage of circumstances. (43)

- people don't want a quarter-inch drill, they want a quarter-inch hole -- but really they want to hang a picture, and they want their house to feel welcoming, or they want to do what others do to make their house welcoming

> we like to think we understand ourselves. But the truth is, we don't. Most of human behavior is a result of subconscious processes. (44)

**two types of memory**
1. declarative memory -- for factual information
2. procedural memory -- recalling activities performed

### Three Levels of Processing
a conceptual model not to be taken too literally, but helpful grounding framework for thinking about what a designer needs to think about when designing
1. **visceral**
    - basic protective mechanism of the human affective system
    - quick judgments based on environment
    - fast and completely subconscious
    - _great designers use aesthetic sensibilities to drive visceral responses_
2. **behavioral**
    - learned skills, triggered by situations that match appropriate patterns
    - _for designers, most critical aspect is that every action is associated with an expectation_
3. **reflective**
    - home of conscious cognition
    - where deep understanding develops, where reasoning and conscious decision-making take place
    - _most important for designer, because memories last far longer than the immediate experience_

### learned helplessness
- a situation where people experience repeated failures at a task, and they decide the task can't be done -- can be overcome with _positive psychology_
- we need to remove _failure_ from our vocabulary -- every failure is a learning opportunity

> human error is usually a result of poor design: it should be called system error. (66)

> It is easy to design devices that work well when everything goes as planned. The hard and necessary part of design is to make things work well even when things do not go as planned. (68)
