# How the World Really Works

## 1: Understanding Energy
> The first chapter of this book shows how our high-energy societies have been steadily increasing their dependence on fossil fuels in general and on electricity, the most flexible form of energy, in particular. Appreciation of these realities serves as a much-needed corrective to the now-common claims (based on a poor understanding of complex realities) that we can decarbonize the global energy supply in a hurry, and that it will take only two or three decades before we rely solely on renewable energy conversions. While we are converting increasing shares of electricity generation to new renewables (solar and wind, as opposed to the long-established hydroelectricity) and putting more electric cars on the roads, decarbonizing trucking, flying, and shipping will be a much greater challenge, as will the production of key materials without relying on fossil fuels.



## 2: Understanding Food Production
> The second chapter of this book is about the most basic survival necessity: producing our food. Its focus is on explaining how much of what we rely on to survive, from wheat to tomatoes to shrimp, has one thing in common: it requires substantial, direct and indirect, fossil fuel inputs. Awareness of this fundamental dependence on fossil fuels leads to a realistic understanding of our continued need for fossil carbon: it is relatively easy to generate electricity by wind turbines or solar cells rather than by burning coal or natural gas—but it would be much more difficult to run all field machinery without liquid fossil fuels and to produce all fertilizers and other agrochemicals without natural gas and oil. In short, for decades it will be impossible to adequately feed the planet without using fossil fuels as sources of energy and raw materials.

> As a result, no recent transformation—such as increased personal mobility or a greater range of private possessions—has been so existentially fundamental as our ability to produce, year after year, a surfeit of food. (46)

- we reduced the malnutrition rate from 2 in 3 people in 1950 to 1 in 11 in 2019, and this doesn't even factor in population growth

> In two centuries, the human labor to produce a kilogram of American wheat was reduced from 10 minutes to less than two seconds. This is how our modern world really works [...] Most of the admired and undoubtedly remarkable technical advances that have transformed industries, transportation, communication, and everyday living would have been impossible if more than 80 percent of all people had to remain in the countryside in order to produce their daily bread (the share of the US population who were farmers in 1800 was 83 percent) or their daily bowl of rice (in Japan, close to 90 percent of people lived in villages in 1800) (51)

- we cannot reliable feed the world currently without relying on fossil fuels -- bread takes ~210-250 mL/kg of fossil fuels, chicken 300-350, and tomatoes 650 mL/kg, and some seafood, like lobster or shrimp or other carnivorous fishes, are 2-3 L/kg!

> at least half of recent global crop harvests have been produced thanks to the application of synthetic nitrogenous compounds, and without them it would be impossible to produce the prevailing diets for even half of today’s nearly 8 billion people. (68)

- so what can we do?
  - we can try and reduce food waste, which is easier than reforming complex processes
  - we can reduce our consumption of meat (complete elimination of meat consumption is doomed to fail)
  - we can hold out hope for renewable and inexpensive electricity generation and adequate large scale storage
  - hold out hope for the perfect solution -- develop grain/oil crops with properties of leguminous plants, whose roots can turn inert nitrogen in the atmosphere into nitrates
