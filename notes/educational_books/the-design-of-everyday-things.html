<p>Every object has certain abilities (affordances) that object allows dependent upon the user of that object. There are ways to signal what those abilities are (signifiers), and how to create those is the key insight of designing. We should design for humans through human-centered design, without the rosy-colored idea that humans are perfect agents and should bend to the machines contours rather than the other way around.</p>

<p><strong>norman doors</strong> - poorly designed doors where it isn’t clear if you should push or pull</p>

<p><strong>two most important parts of design</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>
<em>discoverability</em> - is it even possible to figure out what actions are possible and where and how to perform them?</li>
  <li>
<em>understanding</em> - what does it all mean? how is the product supposed to be used? what do all the different controls and settings mean?</li>
</ol>

</h3>
    
<ol>
  <li>
<em>industrial design</em> - The professional service of creating and developing concepts and specifications that optimize the function, value, and appearance of products and systems for mutual benefit of both user and manufacturer</li>
  <li>
<em>interactive design</em> - The focus is upon how people interact with technology. The goal is to enhance people’s understanding of what can be done, what ishappening, and what has just occurred. Interaction design draws upon principles of psychology, design, art, and emotion to ensure a positive, enjoyable experience.</li>
  <li>
<em>experience design</em> - The practice of designing products, processes, services, events, and environments with a focus placed on the quality and enjoyment of the total experience</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is the duty of machines and those who design them to understand people […] We have to accept human behavior the way it is, not the way that we would wish it to be. (6)</p>

</h3>
    
<ol>
  <li>
<em>discoverability</em> - It is possible to determine what actions are possible and the current state of the device</li>
  <li>
<em>affordances</em> - The proper affordances exist to make the desired action possible
    <ul>
      <li>the relationship between the properties of an object and the capabilities of the agent that determine how the object could be used</li>
      <li>e.g., a chair affords sitting, but a heavy chair might only afford lifting to a few</li>
      <li>importantly, it is not a property but a relationship – key is knowing who will use what you design</li>
      <li>are the possible interactions between people and the environment – some are perceivable, some are not</li>
      <li>perceived affordances often act as signifiers, but they can be ambiguous</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
<em>signifiers</em> - Effective use of signifier ensures discoverability, and that the feedback is well communicated and intelligible
    <ul>
      <li>refers to any mark or sound, any perceivable indicator that communicates the appropriate behavior to a person</li>
      <li>affordances determine what actions are possible, signifiers communicate where the action should take place</li>
      <li>more important than affordances because they communicate how to use the design</li>
      <li>must be perceivable, otherwise they fail to function</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
<em>constraints</em> - Providing physical, logical, semantic, and cultural constraints guides actions and eases interpretations</li>
  <li>
<em>mappings</em> - The relationship between controls and their actions follows the principles of good mapping, enhanced as much as possible through spatial layout and temporal contiguity
    <ul>
      <li>the relationship between the elements of two sets of things</li>
      <li>e.g., a set of light switches and the lights they control, or the controls that move a car seat</li>
      <li>related controls should be grouped together, controls should be close to the item being controlled</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
<em>feedback</em> - There is full and continuous information about the results of actions and the current state of the product or service. After an action has been executed, it is easy to determine the new state.
    <ul>
      <li>some way of letting you know the system is working on your request</li>
      <li>must be immediate</li>
      <li>must be informative</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
<em>conceptual model</em> - The design projects all the information needed to create a good conceptual model of the system, leading to understanding and a feeling of control. The conceptual model enhances both discoverability and evaluation of results
    <ul>
      <li>an explanation, usually highly simplified, of how something works</li>
      <li>depending on your expertise, your conceptual model might be more or less right</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>system image</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>the combined information available to us</li>
  <li>informed by the designer’s conceptual model, and informs the user’s conceptual model</li>

<p>In addition to the affordances and signifiers of any given object, there is also the way humans interact with the object. There are three interaction modes, from the visceral to the behavioral to the reflective, and these follow along cognitive models of fast and slow thinking. Key to designing is understanding how cognition and emotion factor into the way people interact with objects.</p>

<p>We don’t need the entirety of knowledge of how to precisely use something entirely within our head – it is a combination of knowledge in our head and in the world that we can gather. Memory in the head takes several different forms and serves several different purposes. Understanding how memory works, how short-term and long-term memory differ, and how we can build constraints and cues into the world to overcome shortcomings with memory, is key to successful design.</p>

<strong>lock-out</strong> - prevents someone from entering a space that is dangerous, or prevents an event from occurring, e.g., stairways that have a fire barrier to the basement so people escaping fire don’t go all the way to the basement</li>

<p>Defining the modes of interaction for someone using a product are all well and good, but what does the actual act of designing in the real world look like? It is first key to define your problem, first by interrogating it and getting to the real root problem. Then, you apply the same iterative diverge then converge thinking to finding a solution. These processes are best applied iteratively with occasional management gates, and through cross-functional teams. It is expensive and takes a lot of effort to deliver products that meet a real need.</p>

      <li>observe would be customers in natural environment, in their normal lives, wherever the product being deigned would be used (<em>applied ethnography</em>)</li>
      <li>no substitute for interacting directly with customer</li>
      <li>marketing and design should work as complementary to each other – they have different concerns</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
<strong>Idea Generation</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>generate possible solutions</li>
      <li>create numerous ideas, be creative without regards for constraints, and question everything</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
<strong>Prototyping</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>build quick mock-up of each potential solution</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
<strong>Testing</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>gather small group that correspond closely to target audience</li>
      <li>ideally 5 – you can test with 5, change the product, test with 5, etc etc. iterate!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

<strong>activity-centered design</strong> - if the product is being used for many people, you can concentrate on the activities that will be performed, as opposed to a more human-centered design – let the activity define the product and its structure</li>

</h3>
    
<ul>
  <li>task is a small sub-component of a goal</li>
  <li>Carver and Schier suggest three types of goals:
    <ol>
      <li>be-goals – these are foundational, long-lasting, and determine one’s self image</li>
      <li>do-goals – determine the plans and actions to be performed for an activity</li>
      <li>motor-goals – specifies just how the actions are performed</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>design for goals, not tasks</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<strong>waterfall method of design</strong> – linear, progress in single direction, and once decisions have been made it is difficult to go back</li>
  <li>contrast this with more iterative method, where decisions are deferred, time to experiment</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>The goal is to have best of both worlds: iterative experimentation to refine the problem and the solution, coupled with management reviews at the gates […] The trick is to delay precise specifications of the product requirements until some iterative testing with rapidly deployed prototypes has been done. (235)</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>implicit knowledge</strong> - knowledge that only exists in the heads of workers</li>
  <li>
<strong>Norman’s Law of Product Development</strong> - The day a product development process starts, it is behind schedule and above budget.</li>
  <li>
<strong>inclusive/universal design</strong> - designing for people with special needs</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>[C]omplexity is essential: it is confusion that is undesirable. I distinguished between “complexity”, which we need to match the activities we take part in, and “complicated”, which I defined to mean confusion. (247)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Standardization provides a major breakthrough in usability. (248)</p>

</h3>
    
<p>The previous six chapters are theory, this chapter discusses what the actual market forces that dictate the development of product look like. Leans strongly on two examples: videophones, which were conceived in 1897 but still haven’t been realized, and the typewriter and how it settled on the QWERTY keyboard. The realities of market forces mean that most of your product development takes years, will already be behind schedule, and might build off radical innovation but really represents incremental innovation.</p>

<p><strong>Stigler’s Law</strong> - the names of famous people often get attached to ideas even though they had nothing to do with them</p>

    <a href="#innovation" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="innovation"><svg viewbox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Innovation
  
  
</h3>
    
<p>two types of innovation:</p>
<ol>
  <li>radical – changes lives and industries, takes years, decades, or even centuries, hard to predict (black swan)</li>
  <li>incremental – makes things better on a small scale, iterative
    <ul>
      <li>we need both types</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>Design is successful only if the final product is successful – if people buy it, use it, and enjoy it, thus spreading the word. A design that people do not purchase is a failed design, no matter how great the design team might consider it. (293)</p>

</h2>
    
<ol>
  <li>In order to design good products, we need to think about the ways people interact with those products, through affordances, signifiers, constraints, mappings, feedback, and conceptual models. Signifiers are the most important component of good design because they signal what you can or can’t do with a product, what capabilities a product affords based on who is using that product.</li>
  <li>We need our design to be human-centered, to not assume a happy path, to meet the needs and capabilities of those who use it rather than the other way around. Great design produces pleasurable experiences, experiences that delight, and the key to this is putting the human in the center of your design rather than building in the abstract.</li>

<p>Rating: 9/10
I think over time, this rating might drift up to a 10. This book has lent me a vocabulary to wield in the battle to build usable systems. It is no exaggeration to say that thinking about usability in the way Norman posits has been the difference between success and failure for systems and processes I’ve built. This book is canon for user-centered design and for anyone who designs anything to be used by humans.</p>
