</h1>
    
<p><strong>modularity</strong> - a logical grouping of related code, which could be a group of classes in an object-oriented language or functions in a structured or functional language, e.g., <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">package</code> in Java, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">namespace</code> in .NET</p>

</h2>
    
<p><strong>Cohesion</strong> refers to what extent the parts of a module should be contained within the same module – less precise than coupling</p>

<p>From best to worst cohesion</p>
<ol>
  <li>
<strong>functional cohesion</strong> - every part of the module is related to the other, and the module contains everything essential to function</li>
  <li>
<strong>sequential cohesion</strong> - two modules interact, where one outputs data that becomes the input for the other</li>
  <li>
<strong>communicational cohesion</strong> - two modules form a communication chain, where each operates on info and/or contributes to some output</li>
  <li>
<strong>procedural cohesion</strong> - two modules must execute code in a particular order</li>
  <li>
<strong>temporal cohesion</strong> - modules are related based on timing dependencies</li>
  <li>
<strong>logical cohesion</strong> - data within modules is related logically but not functionally</li>
  <li>
<strong>coincidental cohesion</strong> - elements in a module are not related other than being in the same source file</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>the <strong>Chidamber and Kemerer Object- oriented metrics suite</strong> is a well-known suite of metrics to test cohesion (and coupling) like cyclomatic complexity</li>
  <li>
<strong>Chidamber and Kemerer Lack of Cohesion in Methods</strong> (LCOM) – The sum of sets of methods not shared via sharing fields</li>

</h2>
    
<p><strong>afferent coupling</strong> - measures the number of <em>incoming</em> connections to a code artifact (component, class, function, etc)</p>

<p><strong>efferent coupling</strong> - measures number of <em>outgoing</em> connections to a code artifact</p>

<p><strong>abstractness</strong> - ratio of abstract artifacts (abstract classes, interfaces, etc) to concrete artifacts (implementation)</p>

<p><strong>instability</strong> - ratio of efferent coupling to the sum of both efferent and afferent coupling – determines volatility of code base; an unstable codebase breaks more easily when changed</p>

<p><strong>distance from the main sequence</strong>
$D = |A + I - 1|$</p>

<p><strong>architecture fitness functions</strong> - any mechanism that provides an objective integrity assessment of some architecture characteristic or combination of architecture characteristics</p>
<ul>
  <li>cyclic dependencies – how many modules import other modules; code reviews help, but a fitness function as part of continuous integration is better</li>
  <li>distance from the main sequence – again, best as fitness function test as part of continuous integration – metrics tools like JDepend or ArchUnit (Java) NetArchTest (.NET) for fitness testing</li>

<strong>high functional cohesion</strong> - how well the contained code is unified – a quantum does something purposeful
<strong>synchronous connascence</strong> - synchronous calls within an application context or between distributed services that form the quantum</p>

<p><strong>bounded context</strong> - from domain-driven design – everything related to the domain is visible internally but opaque to other bounded contexts – each entity works best within a localized context</p>

</h2>
    
<ul>

  <li>technical partitioning - breaking the architecture into technical capabilities (presentation, business rules, services, etc)</li>

</div>

<p><strong>Architecture Exposition Cycle</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>
<em>identify initial components</em> - what partitioning to use, what components, etc.</li>
  <li>
<em>assign requirements to components</em> - align to see how well they fit</li>
  <li>
<em>analyze roles and responsibilities</em> - allows architect to align component and domain granularity</li>
  <li>
<em>analyze architecture characteristics</em> - think about how these characteristics impact component division and granularity</li>
  <li>
<em>restructure components</em> - based on feedback, continuously iterate with developers</li>
</ol>

<p>Identifying Components</p>
<ul>
  <li>
<strong>actor/actions</strong> - architects identify actors who perform activities with the application and the actions those actors may perform</li>
  <li>
<strong>event storming</strong> - assuming the project uses messages and/or events to communicate components, the team tries to determine which events occur in the system based on requirements and identified roles, and build components around those events and message handlers</li>
  <li>
<strong>workflow approach</strong> - The workflow approach models the components around workflows, much like event storming, but without the explicit constraints of building a message-based system; a workflow approach identifies the key roles, determines the kinds of workflows these roles engage in, and builds components around the identified activities.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>entity trap anti-pattern</strong> - take each entity and create a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Manager</code> for it – this isn’t an architecture, it’s an object-relational mapping (ORM) of a framework of a database; should just use an off-the-shelf solution like Naked Objects in .NET or Isis in Java to create simple front-ends on databases</p>

<ul>
  <li>each layer can either be <em>closed</em> or <em>open</em>
    <ul>
      <li>
<em>closed</em> means that as request moves top-down through layers, it can’t skip any layer</li>
      <li>
<em>open</em> means it can</li>
      <li>
<strong>fast lane reader pattern</strong> - request might go directly to database to serve simple requests</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>open or closed is important for <em>isolation of concerns</em>
    <ul>
      <li>change in one layer shouldn’t affect others if contracts between remain the same</li>
      <li>also allows layers to be replaced (e.g., replacing presentation running angular with react)</li>

<p><strong>core system</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>minimum functionality to run the system, or happy path (general processing flow) through the application</li>
  <li>might have a monolithic presentation layer, either embedded within the core system or as a layer on top</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>plug-in component</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>standalone, independent components that contain specialized processing, additional features, and custom code meant to extend or enhance the core system</li>
  <li>can also be used to isolate highly volatile code</li>
  <li>components should have no dependencies between them (other than core system)</li>
  <li>runtime plug-ins can be managed through frameworks without needing to redeploy system (Open Service Gateway Initiative, Penrose, Jigsaw (Java) or Prism (.NET))</li>
  <li>don’t always need to use point-to-point communication – can use REST or messaging to provide more decoupling
    <ul>
      <li>this creates better scalability and throughput and allows more runtime changes</li>
      <li>makes it a distributed architecture</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>not common for plug-in components to connect to centrally shared database (for decoupling purposes), each component has its own data store</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>registry</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>contains information about each plug-in module, including things like name, data contract, and remote access protocol details</li>
  <li>can be internal, or external such as ZooKeeper or Consul</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>contracts</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>contracts between plug-in components and core system are usually standard across domain</li>
  <li>
    <p>include behavior, input data, and output data returned from plug-in</p>
  </li>
  <li>IDEs, Jenkins, Jira, Confluence are a good example of this architecture</li>

<strong>error handling</strong> - can use the workflow event pattern of reactive architecture, where if an error occurs, it is immediately sent to a workflow processor that tries to fix the error and resend the message, or logs it to a centralized location where an operator can view it</li>
  <li>
<strong>broadcast</strong> - can send message out without knowledge of who is receiving and what they do with it</li>

</h2>
    
<ul>
  <li>built out of domain-driven design</li>
  <li>primary goal is high decoupling, physically modeling the logical notion of bounded context</li>
  <li>distributed architecture – each service runs its own process either on a physical computer or virtual machine or container</li>
  <li>performance is a negative side effect, as network calls take longer than method calls, security verification at endpoints adds processing time</li>
  <li>determining granularity key to success</li>

<p><strong>bounded context</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>driving philosophy</li>
  <li>each service models a domain or workflow, and each service includes everything necessary to operate within the application</li>
  <li>granularity can be determined by
    <ul>
      <li>purpose - functional cohesion</li>
      <li>transactions - what needs to cooperate in a transaction</li>
      <li>choreography - if services require extensive communication to function, you can bundle to limit communication overhead</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>data isolation</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>avoid coupling of schemas and databases as integration points</li>
  <li>need to abandon the idea of a single source of truth</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>API layer</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>should not be used as a mediator or orchestration tool</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>operational reuse</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>can use the sidecar pattern to handle all operational concerns that teams benefit from coupling together</li>
  <li>if you need to update all monitoring, for example, you can upgrade sidecar and then anyone using it can benefit from upgrade</li>
  <li>if each service requires a common sidecar, can build a <strong>service mesh</strong> to allow unified control across arch for things like logging and monitoring</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>frontends</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>original idea had user interfaces as part of microservice, but this isn’t practical (there might be concerns like common styling, deployment patterns, extra complexity)</li>
  <li>
<strong>monolithic user interface</strong> - single user interface that calls through the API layer to satisfy requests</li>
  <li>
<strong>microfrontends</strong> - components at the user interface level to create a synchronous level of granularity and isolation (frameworks like React)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>communication</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>must decide on sync or async communication</li>
  <li>typically use protocol-aware heterogenous interoperability
    <ul>
      <li>
<em>protocol-aware</em> - need to know which protocol to use (REST, SOAP, message queues, etc)</li>
      <li>
<em>heterogenous</em> - fully supports polyglot environments</li>
      <li>
<em>interoperability</em> - services can call each other to send and receive data</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>for async communication, need events and messages</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>choreography and orchestration</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>should look at <em>Domain/architecture isomorphism</em> (how well the architecture fits the domain) when assessing how appropriate an architecture style is for a particular problem</li>
  <li>can use the <em>front controller</em> pattern, where a nominally choreographed service becomes a more complex mediator</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>transactions and sagas</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>building transactions across service boundaries violates the core decoupling principle</li>
  <li>
<strong>compensating transaction framework</strong> - if a transaction across multiple services fails, some mediator needs to reverse the transaction on other services
    <ul>
      <li>requires significant complexity, creates lots of coordination traffic</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<strong>data architecture</strong> - architects and DBAs must collaborate on database, schema, and other data concerns</li>
  <li>
<strong>organizational factors</strong> - external factors such as cloud vendor cost</li>
  <li>
<strong>domain/architecture isomorphism</strong> - does the problem domain match the topology of the architecture</li>
  <li><strong>monolith vs. distributed</strong></li>
  <li><strong>where does the data live</strong></li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>async or synchronous</strong></p>

  <li>
<strong>backends for frontends pattern</strong> - make the API layer a thin microkernel adaptor, supplying general info from backend, and translates to suitable format for frontend</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>architecturally significant</strong>: those decisions that affect</p>
<ul>
  <li>structure: decisions that impact patterns or styles</li>

  <li>architect avoids making an architecture decision out of fear of making the wrong choice</li>
  <li>two ways to overcome:

</ul>

<p><strong>groundhog day</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>people don’t know what decision is made, so it keeps getting discussed over and over again</li>
  <li>when justifying architecture decisions, need to provide technical and business justifications</li>
  <li>most basic business justifications: cost, time to market, user satisfaction, and strategic positioning</li>

<p><strong>Representational consistency</strong> is the practice of always showing the relationship between parts of an architecture, either in diagrams or presentations, before changing views
<strong>irrational artifact attachment</strong> - relationship between a person’s irrational attachment to some artifact and how long it took to produce</p>
