# Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow
## the good
A book about video games, and not told in a patronizing way. There are explanations of video game terminology, and this isn't _Hackers_, but you can see the influence. Despite Jojo Moyes endorsement on the jacket, this isn't a romance novel per se, although it does end happily. Sam and Sadie are suitably frustrating and this isn't a Hallmark book. The english nerd in me enjoyed the morsels of literary allusions (any book that sprinkles in some J Alfred Prufrock and his peach proclivity is ok in my estimation).

## the bad
I feel like some of the more potent themes, multi-culturalism, identity, narrative technique, etc. could've been a bit more developed. It's a book about games, but things like cultural appropriation are brushed off as anachronisms, and what you ultimately have is a novel about three immensely successful game designers forming some not-so-intricate love triangle.

## the ugly
Not much ugly in this one.

## the verdict
Enjoyable read that moved right along in its pacing and narrative. I can see why it's had the runaway success it has -- not challenging in a deep way, but challenging enough to feel like you aren't reading cotton candy.
