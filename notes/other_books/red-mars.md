# Red Mars
Despite being published 20 years prior to _the ministry of the future_, I can see the same sort of approach to narrative, to world-building, in _red mars_. The book follows a few different third person focused narrators of the original first 100 to Mars, and it is mostly a slow burn until the last 50 or so pages, when nearly everything falls apart. robinson seeds future plot points early, only for them to pay off in the final chapters. I wouldn't say his strength is narrative -- action happens almost indirectly. but robinson has built an amazingly convincing world of mars, one that is mostly believable. one of the things I keep coming back to while reading this, especially after reading _how the world really works_ is the impossible cost of energy that all this martian civilization would require. the energy infrastructure alone is staggering, and in this book you have these atom reclaimers that literally pull molecules from the sky to build other molecules. the energy cost of that sounds like it would be astonishing.

this does come close to scratching that same sort of itch that Cixin Liu's series has, a science fiction novel that is alive with ideas. I would think this is more speculative fiction than strictly science fiction, but they both go to the same parties and have mostly the same friends.

I really liked the space elevator, although I still can't really wrap my head around how it works. Also, any future space that _doesn't_ have corporations (in this book called transnationals) taking over things is delusional. Also the gene therapy that might make people live forever is fun. Playing with the cultural connotations is a good time, and what else would result but a fierce increase of the schism between rich and poor, between mortal and immortal, and thus lead to chaos?

this book is one of dichotomies, between the fundamental duality of creation and destruction that humanity can summon, between green earth and red mars, terran and areolian. everywhere man goes, they make in their own image, including turning red mars into blue mars.

the book ends with a ragtag contingent of the original 100, numbers severely diminished, joining their long lost sister Hiroko, who left Underhill, the first civilization, several decades prior. There is a promise of starting a new martian civilization in the wake of all the carnage. Frank Chalmers and John Boone and Arkady Bogdanovich are dead, many of the other first 100 are dead, but those that remain might be virtually immortal. looking forward to green mars and then blue mars.
