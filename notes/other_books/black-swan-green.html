<p>At this point, I think David Mitchell could do anything fiction-wise. <em>Black Swan Green</em>, eschewing the grandiose narrative and temporal sweeps of his other novels, concerns a 13 year old Jason Taylor coming of age, as 13 year old boys are wont to do, amidst the backdrop of the dissolution of his parent’s marriage in a small town in Worcestershire, UK. The book spans 13 chapters, each a well-hewn vignette of gained experience, each a step towards that age that Jason Taylor is coming to. The book does what no other Mitchell novel has so far, which is constrain itself to a single narrator in a confined timeline. In Jason Taylor, Mitchell finds an authentic voice, in part perhaps because this is Mitchell’s most autobiographical novel (as if any novel couldn’t be said to be pulled from some experience), Mitchell having shared the same vocal falterings as Jason Taylor (heretofore JT). At times this veers into the preternaturally precocious. What 13 year old kid might say “a brick of loneliness is reaching terminal velocity inside me”? Mitchell brings a little more realism when he has JT declare “This druid feeling I get in the woods’s so thrilling it makes me want to crap”.</p>

<p>When I was younger and I was just learning how to play the guitar, I remember hearing Stevie Ray Vaughan and thinking to myself that what he did sounded easy to do. Took me 6 months of playing to disabuse me of the notion that that primal cement mixer sound of Stevie’s was anything easy to create. I feel the same way with Mitchell – the uniformity and unrelenting authenticity of his prose, the cleverness of the structure evinced by genre, the risks, the performance, all are so hard to do on their own, and within Mitchell you find an author who can hit the lexical equivalent of 6 octaves. The only criticism you might levy is Mitchell is too good, him a basso, his voice echoing underneath the text, so you get Mitchell as a 13 year old boy, Mitchell as a Dutch clerk, Mitchell as an older publisher. That sort of criticism only stands because we expect so much out of Mitchell. I know whatever he writes I will be picking up, rapt.</p>
