# Chapter 1: Showing Up
## grit
{: .no_toc }
- combination of _perseverance_ and _passion_
- opposite of complacent

# Chapter 2: Distracted by Talent
_talent is not all there is to achievement_

{: .no_toc }
- half cousin to Charles Darwin
- studied why people succeed and others fail
- was a _wunderkind_, at 4 could read and write, at 6 knew Latin and could recite passages from Shakespeare from memory
- thought successful were remarkable in three ways: demonstrate unusual "ability" in combination with exceptional "zeal" and "the capacity for hard labor"

## naturalness bias

## the war for talent
{: .no_toc }
- older book, basic premise that companies in the modern enconomy rise and fall depending on their ability to attract and retain "A players"
- companies that excel aggressively promote the most talented employees and get rid of the least talented
- this "talent mindset" led directly to Enron and Jeff Skilling
> the biggest reason a preoccupation with talent can be harmful is simple: By shining a spotlight on talent, we risk leaving everything else in the shadows. We inadvertently send the message that these other factors -- including grit, don't matter as much as they really do (31)
