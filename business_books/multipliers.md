## 1: The Multiplier Effect
### Multipliers vs Diminishers
- **multipliers** - leaders are genius makers who bring out the intelligence in others. they built collective, viral, intelligence in organizations
- **diminishers** - these leaders are absorbed in their own intelligence, stifle others, and deplete the organization of crucial intelligence and capability

### The Five Disciplines of Multipliers

2. The Liberator: Requires people's best thinking
3. The Challeneger: Extends challenges
4. The Debate Maker: Debates decisions
5. The Investor: Instills accountability

### Accidental Diminisher
- much of the diminishing that happens in the workplace is a result of well-intended leaders whose honest attempts ot lead or be helpful shut down ideas and cause others to hold back

- by extracting people's full capability, Multipliers get twice the capability from people as Diminishers

## 2: The Talent Magnet
- **Empire Builder** - brings in great talent, but under-utilizes it because they board resources and use them only for their own gain
- **Talent Magnets** - get access to the best talent because people flock to work for them, knowing they will be fully utilized and developed to be ready for the next stage

|               | Empire Builders                                                                           | Talent Magnets                                                                         |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| What They Do  | Hoard resources and underutilize talent                                                   |  Attract talent and deploy it at its highest point of contribution                     |
| What They Get | A reputation as the person A players should avoid working for ("the place you go to die") | A reputation as the person A players should work for ("the place you go to grow")      |
|               | Underutilized people whose capability atrophies                                           | Fully utilized people whose genius continues to expand                                 |
|               | Disillusioned A players who don't reach out to other A players                            | Inspired A players who attract other A players into the organization                   |
|               | A stagnation of talent where disillusioned A players quit and stay                        | A flow of A players attracting other A players as they then move up and out of the org |

### Unexpected Findings
1. Both Talent Managers and Empire Builders attract top talent. What differentiates them is what they do with the talent once it's in the door.
2. Talent Magnets don't run out of talent by moving their people to bigger, better opportunities, because there is a steady stream of talent wanting to get into their organization.
