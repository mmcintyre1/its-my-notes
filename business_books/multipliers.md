## 1: The Multiplier Effect
### Multipliers vs Diminishers
- **multipliers** - leaders are genius makers who bring out the intelligence in others. they built collective, viral, intelligence in organizations
- **diminishers** - these leaders are absorbed in their own intelligence, stifle others, and deplete the organization of crucial intelligence and capability

### The Five Disciplines of Multipliers
1. The Talent Magnet: Attracts and optimizes talent
2. The Liberator: Requires people's best thinking
3. The Challeneger: Extends challenges
4. The Debate Maker: Debates decisions
5. The Investor: Instills accountability

### Accidental Diminisher
- much of the diminishing that happens in the workplace is a result of well-intended leaders whose honest attempts ot lead or be helpful shut down ideas and cause others to hold back

- by extracting people's full capability, Multipliers get twice the capability from people as Diminishers
