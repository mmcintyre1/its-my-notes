# The Starfish and the Spider
_The Unstoppable Power of Leaderless Organizations_

**centralized organization**
- spider - has a head that you can destroy to kill the spider
- like the Incas or Aztecs or a government
- has a leader
- specific place where decisions are made
- is _coercive_ as there is a leader who calls the shots

**decentralized organization**
- starfish - can remove legs and starfish still functions
- like Apaches, or AA, or open-source software, or terrorist cells
- no leader, no hierarchy, no headquarters
- is 'open' and flat, and power is distributed among all people

| CEO | Catalyst |
|- | - |
| the boss | a peer |
| command and control | trust |
| rational | emotionally intelligent |
| powerful | inspirational |
| directive | collaborative |
| in the spotlight | behind the scenes |
| order | ambiguity |
| organizing | connecting |

**the accordion principle** - moving back and forth between two states -- in this case between centralized and decentralized

**principles of decentralization**
1. when attacked, a decentralized organization tends to become even more open and decentralized.
2. it’s easy to mistake starfish for spiders
3. an open system doesn’t have central intelligence; the intelligence is spread throughout the system
4. open systems can easily mutate
5. the decentralized organization sneaks up on you
6. as industries become decentralized, overall profits decrease.
7. put people into an open system and they’ll automatically want to contribute
8. when attacked, centralized organizations tend to become even more centralized

**Rules for the New World**
1. Diseconomies of scale from centralization
- huge, centralized companies quickly start being less efficient and less effective than smaller, more nimble and distributed ones
2. Network effects
3. The power of chaos for creativity
- order and structure can often hamper creativity
4. Knowledge is at the edge, not centered
- look to the fringes for who has the most cutting edge information
5. Everyone wants to contribute
6. Beware of the Hydra response
- based on the Greek myth, where attacking a decentralized organization like a multi-headed snake creates more proliferation of snake heads
7. Catalysts rule
8. The values are the organization
9.  Measure, monitor, and manage
- just because something is decentralized doesn't mean you can't measure it; just choose what to measure carefully based on the decentralized structure
10. Flatten or be flattened
- decentralize through some hybrid approach or be taken over by someone else who is decentralized

## Why I read this book
---
This was mentioned on the Software Engineering Daily podcast by Ruben Harris, and he spoke highly of the novel. Also, it was a top 10 business book in 2006. Can't go wrong, right?

## One key takeaway
---
Some organizations are flat or decentralized, and some are hierarchical or centralized, and by understanding the difference, we can drive positive outcomes by the way we structure our organizations.

## Summary
---
The book jumps through a few historical examples of some centralized and decentralized organizations (the Apaches are decentralized and the Aztecs are centralized), as well as weighing in on the record label and music access scene of the early aughts (which feels a bit quaint, 15 years on).

## How was the book
---
2006 was a long time ago. I think it might be closer to the moon landing than it is to today. Don't look that up. Facebook had just rolled over for the first time, sickly gurgling on the floor. Napster was gone, and Justin Timberlake was a few years off from regurgitating Sean Parker's name back into the cultural vulgate. Computers existed, and AOL may or may not have still been minting new CDs to give the world free internet. I'm not sure. This review is only haphazardly researched (it turns out finding an actual timeline of the past in tech is hard, amnesiatically compelled as we are for the instant gratification of the next IPO). But, we didn't have Uber, or AirBnb, or WeWork, or any of the now ubiquitous "share everything" companies that have democratized (and then capitalized, because isn't that always the way we inflate and then deflate the accordion) private property.

Things are now "flatter" than they've ever been -- global access to labor markets never higher, fractional prices to rent experiences enabling personal consumption never before seen. They even have a toilet in South Korea that shoots water then hot air up your ass to clean then pamper. I've sat on it. Thing is, this book, despite being one of the top 10 business books of 2006, and having a review on the back by someone who was spoken of fondly in the book (Dave Martin, where are you now?!), I don't know if it said anything new even in 2006. Malcolm Gladwell talked about "catalysts" in 2000 in The Tipping Point, giving a more robust hierarchy of mavens, connectors, and some third category that escapes me (So many of these business books are populated with this rare <i>ubermensch</i> of a character type; the selfless and hard-working apostle who endeavors to make the Jesus's dreams a reality). Friedman covered the economic aspect in The World Is Flat. Much better books have been written on open source development, on Cortes and the Aztecs (the story in this novel is plain rice cakes compared to the actual events -- I think Cortes conquered the 20 million strong Aztec empire with like 30 guys with ridiculous hats and some blunderbusses), hell, even on starfish and spiders.

This book is the worst sort of business book, part simplistic animal metaphor, part survey of pop sociology and pop psychology and scant history to weave some sort of narrative that justifies its premise. Straw men were invented by business books. And I'm party to it. I bought the damn thing, thinking, if nothing else, I would come away with some actionable insight into either capital B Business or at least an increased familiarity with marine biology, but not the case. If nothing else, the book was short. And if you are looking for the Malcolm Gladwell version of the impossibly low priced supermarket brand's version of Coke, this is your echinodermatic book!
