# The Starfish and the Spider
_The Unstoppable Power of Leaderless Organizations_

**centralized organization**
- spider - has a head that you can destroy to kill the spider
- like the Incas or Aztecs or a government
- has a leader
- specific place where decisions are made
- is _coercive_ as there is a leader who calls the shots

**decentralized organization**
- starfish - can remove legs and starfish still functions
- like Apaches, or AA, or open-source software, or terrorist cells
- no leader, no hierarchy, no headquarters
- is 'open' and flat, and power is distributed among all people

| CEO | Catalyst |
|- | - |
| the boss | a peer |
| command and control | trust |
| rational | emotionally intelligent |
| powerful | inspirational |
| directive | collaborative |
| in the spotlight | behind the scenes |
| order | ambiguity |
| organizing | connecting |

**the accordion principle** - moving back and forth between two states -- in this case between centralized and decentralized

**principles of decentralization**
1. when attacked, a decentralized organization tends to become even more open and decentralized.
2. it’s easy to mistake starfish for spiders
3. an open system doesn’t have central intelligence; the intelligence is spread throughout the system
4. open systems can easily mutate
5. the decentralized organization sneaks up on you
6. as industries become decentralized, overall profits decrease.
7. put people into an open system and they’ll automatically want to contribute
8. when attacked, centralized organizations tend to become even more centralized

**Rules for the New World**
1. Diseconomies of scale from centralization
- huge, centralized companies quickly start being less efficient and less effective than smaller, more nimble and distributed ones
2. Network effects
3. The power of chaos for creativity
- order and structure can often hamper creativity
4. Knowledge is at the edge, not centered
- look to the fringes for who has the most cutting edge information
5. Everyone wants to contribute
6. Beware of the Hydra response
- based on the Greek myth, where attacking a decentralized organization like a multi-headed snake creates more proliferation of snake heads
7. Catalysts rule
8. The values are the organization
9.  Measure, monitor, and manage
- just because something is decentralized doesn't mean you can't measure it; just choose what to measure carefully based on the decentralized structure
10. Flatten or be flattened
- decentralize through some hybrid approach or be taken over by someone else who is decentralized

## Why I read this book
---
This was mentioned on the Software Engineering Daily podcast by Ruben Harris, and he spoke highly of the novel. Also, it was a top 10 business book in 2006. Can't go wrong, right?

## One key takeaway
---
Some organizations are flat or decentralized, and some are hierarchical or centralized, and by understanding the difference, we can drive positive outcomes by the way we structure our organizations.

## Summary
---
The book jumps through a few historical examples of some centralized and decentralized organizations (the Apaches are decentralized and the Aztecs are centralized), as well as weighing in on the record label and music access scene of the early aughts (which feels a bit quaint, 15 years on).
