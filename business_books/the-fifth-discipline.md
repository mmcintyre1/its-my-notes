# Chapter 1

> The tools and ideas presented in this book are for destroying the illusion that the world is created of separate, unrelated forces. (3)

> The organizations that will truly excel in the future will be the organizations that discover how to tap people's commitment and capacity to learn at all levels in an organization. (4)

- work has shifted from material to intrinsic value and thus we view work as a social institution
- Five Disciplines:
  - **systems thinking** - everything that happens is likely part of a system -- "we tend to focus on snapshots of isolated parts of the system, and wonder why our deepest problems never seem to get solved." (8)
  - **personal mastery** - "the discipline of continually clarifying and deepening our personal vision, of focusing our energies, of developing patience, and of seeing reality objectively."
  - **mental models** - the pictures or heuristics we use to understand the world -- "deeply ingrained assumptions, generalizations, or even pictures or images that influence how we understand the world and how we take action"
  - **shared vision** - building a vision of the shared future we create
  - **team learning** - teams can be more than the sum of their parts by learning -- "When teams are truly learning, not only are they producing extraordinary results but the individual members are growing more rapidly than could have occurred otherwise."
- the fifth discipline is systems thinking -- all other disciplines are fed by it
- **metanoia** - shift of mind, which underpins how we view "real" learning, as opposed to the common view of learning, which is taking in info
- business gives you freedom to experiment and since earnings present an objective and quantifiable result, you can ostensibly test your experiments

# Chapter 2

## Learning Disabilities of Organizations
1. _I am my position_
  - when you see your identity as your role, your view of responsibilities ends at your position
2. _The enemy is out there_
  - an offshoot of _I am my position_ -- you always perceive fault as outside one's own context/boundaries
3. _The illusion of taking charge_
  - often proactiveness is reactiveness in disguise, especially if it is other-directed (reacting to market, customer complaint, etc.)
  - true proactiveness is inward-directed (how do we create our own problems)
4. _Fixation on events_
  - we are conditioned to view everything as a series of events, each with a single cause, but change is a slow process and the causes are often cyclical
5. _The parable of the boiled frog_
  - we tend not to notice slow, gradual change
  - "Learning to see slow, gradual processes requires slowing down our frenetic pace and paying attention to the subtle as well as the dramatic." (25)
6. _The delusion of learning from experience_
  - " we learn best from experience but we never directly experience the consequences of many of our most important decisions." (25)
7. _The myth of the management team_
  - Management team is adapt at avoiding real learning or accountability, "skilled incompetence" as Argyris calls it

# Chapter 3

- the beer game can be played to demonstrate how a lack of systems thinking can lead to disastrous results

**setup**:
  - you have a retailer, wholesaler, and brewery, and they don't talk to each other. Customer demand increases on the retailer, and this causes ballooning and cascading demand to cripple the entire supply chain as retailer overreacts to shipment delays, and on down

3 important lessons to the beer game:
  1. **Structure influence behavior**
  - when different people are placed in the same system, they tend to produce the same results
  - the system causes its own behavior
  1. **Structure in human systems is subtle**
  - we often have the power to alter the structure of the system we are operating in
  - need someone to blame when there are problems, first one another, then the customer, then the system itself
  2. **Leverage often comes from new ways of thinking**
  - need to understand how your position fits within the system
  - in order to succeed, others must succeed

Types of Explanations
1. Systemic Structure (generative)
  - structure produces behavior, so changing structure changes behavior
  - "redesigning our own decision making redesigns the system structure." (53)
2. Patterns of Behavior (responsive)
  - seeing long-term trends and focusing on their implications
3. Events (reactive)
  - simple cause and effect
  - easiest to do but least beneficial

# Chapter 4
## Laws of the Fifth Discipline
1. Today's problems come from yesterday's solutions
- solutions that merely shift problem to another part of the system go undetected
2. The harder you push, the harder the system pushes back
- lay of compensating feedback
3. behavior grows better before it grows worse
- the dominoes will eventually fall
4. The easy way usually leads back in
- "Pushing harder and harder on familiar solutions, while fundamental problems persist or worsen, is a reliable indicator of nonsystemic thinkingâ€”what we often call the "what we need here is a bigger hammer" syndrome." (61)
5. The cure can be worse than the disease
- shifting the burden to the intervenor
6. Faster is slower
7. Cause and effect are not closely related in time and space
8. small changes can lead to big results, but areas of highest leverage are often the least obvious
- "small, well-focused actions can sometimes produce significant, enduring improvements, if they're in the right place. Systems thinkers refer to this principle as "leverage." (64)
9. You can have your cake and eat it too, but not at once
- problems might be improperly stated as "either-or" but both can be improved over the long-term
10. Dividing an elephant in half does not produce two elephants
- often the whole needs to be examined instead of component parts
11. There is no blame
- everything is part of the same system, there is no "other"

# Chapter 5
- systems thinking is the discipline for seeing the structures that underlie complex situations and for discerning high from low leverage

**2 types of complexity**
1. detail complexity: lots of variables
2. dynamic complexity: effects over time of intervention are not obvious

- essence of systems thinking is a shift of mind (metanoia)
  - seeing interrelationships, not linear cause and effect
  - seeing processes of change instead of snapshots
- English language, in subject-verb-object construction, is biased towards cause and effect thinking, but in a system every influence is both a cause and effect
- need to think in circles, understanding feedback and how it "builds to learning to recognize types of "structures" that recur again and again" (73)
- human actor is not separate from the feedback process but part of it
- **delays** are interruptions in time between two influences corresponding

**2 types of feedback processes**
1. reinforcing (amplifying)
- engines of growth or decline
- vicious or virtuous cycles
2. balancing (stabilizing)
- operates where there is goal-oriented behavior seeking stability
- to understand you must know both the explicit as well as the implicit goals
- more difficult to see because nothing might appear to be happening, maintains the status quo
- resistance to change almost always arises from threats to traditional norms and ways of doing things

# Chapter 6
- patterns of structures recur again and again
- not enough to just recognize these structures, we must change the underlying thinking that produces the problem

## Limits to Growth
- an amplifying process that leads to an inadvertent second loop that limits growth
- need to address balancing loop, not reinforcing loop
- very often a cultural change
- **KEY**: don't push growth, remove factors limiting growth

![Limits to Growth](./assets/fifth-discipline-limits-to-growth.png)

- **EXAMPLES**: new sales increase revenue, but increase the need for more senior engineers to manage and thus reducing the senior engineer pool to deliver on products, leading to delays in product delivery and reduced sales

## Shifting the Burden
- an underlying problem creates symptoms that demand attention, but the underlying problem is hard to address, so a solution that handles the symptoms is implemented, leaving the underlying problem to fester and grow
- a special case of shifting the burden is _Eroding Goals_
  - whenever there is a gap between performance and goals, two pressures exists -> 1) improve the situation 2) lower goals
  - need to strengthen fundamental (ideal) response (first, identify it!), and also weaken symptomatic response
- strengthening fundamental response requires long-term orientation and shared vision
- weakening the symptomatic response requires willingness to tell the truth about palliatives and "looking good" solutions
- **KEY**: Beware the symptomatic solution. In the short term it feels good to address symptoms. In the long-term, these symptoms will recur, making a symptomatic solution easier.

- **EXAMPLE** - alcohol to treat stress

# Chapter 7
- intuition of many experienced managers that it is vital to hold critical performance goals through thick and thin, and those standards are most important that matter to the customer

## Limit Growth through Underinvestment
- build less capacity than is needed to serve customer demand
- hard to see because it is gradual and managers prioritize other problems
- systems thinking is important to organize detail complexity into a coherent story, what is important vs. what is not

# Chapter 8
- organizations learn only through individuals that learn
## Personal Mastery
- discipline of growth and learning
two underlying movements
1. clarifying what is important to us
2. continually learning how to see the current reality more clearly
- **creative tension** between what we want and where we are relative to what we want, and this drives learning
- learning doesn't mean acquiring info, but ability to produce results we truly want in life
- continual learning mode -- never arrive
- "People with a high level of personal mastery are acutely aware of their ignorance, their incompetence, their growth areas. And they are deeply self-confident." (133)
- resistance to learning might come from
  - those who think the idea is "soft" or unquantifiable
  - cynics -- those who mistook ideals for expectations, _i.e.,_ frustrated idealists

### Discipline of Personal Mastery
**personal vision**
- "The ability to focus on ultimate intrinsic desires, not only on secondary goals, is a cornerstone of personal mastery." (137)
- sometimes expressed as "genuine caring"
- "But vision is different from purpose. Purpose is similar to a direction, a general heading. Vision is a specific destination, a picture of a desired future. Purpose is abstract. Vision is concrete. Purpose is "advancing man's capability to explore the heavens." Vision is 'a man on the moon by the end of the 1960s.' Purpose is 'being the best I can be,' 'excellence.' Vision is breaking four minutes in the mile." (138)

**creative tension**
- gap between vision and current reality
- not to be confused with being in a state of anxiety, which is _emotional tension_
- it is not what vision is, it's what it does, how it leads to growth
- "Failure is, simply, a shortfall, evidence of the gap between vision and current reality. Failure is an opportunity for learning" (143)

**structural conflict**
- most of us hold one of two contradictory beliefs
1. our powerlessness to bring our world into being
2. our unworthiness of the endeavor
- this leads to 3 coping strategies
1. letting vision erode
2. conflict manipulation - creating a conflict to incite additional effort
3. will power - bulldoze through by sheer will
- one way to overcome structural conflict is to tell the truth, "to root out the ways we limit or deceive ourselves from seeing what is, and to continually challenge our theories of why things are the way they are" (148)

**using the subconscious**
- use the automatic mind to achieve vision
- focus on the desired result itself by asking "what would it get me?"
- "what matters most is the visible behavior of people in leadership positions in sharing their own personal visions and demonstrating their commitment to the truth." (155)

- systems perspective illuminates personal mastery by
1. integrating reason and intuition -- giving managers who rely on intuition a language to express that intuition reasonably
2. connectedness to the world - "to continually expand our awareness and understanding, to see more and more of the interdependencies between actions and our reality, to see more and more of our connectedness to the world around us." (160)
3. compassion and empathy
4. commitment to the whole - "work relentlessly to foster a climate in which the principles of personal mastery are practiced in daily life" (162)
