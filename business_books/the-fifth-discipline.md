- Five Disciplines:
  - **systems thinking** - everything that happens is likely part of a system -- "we tend to focus on snapshots of isolated parts of the system, and wonder why our deepest problems never seem to get solved." (8)
  - **personal mastery** - "the discipline of continually clarifying and deepening our personal vision, of focusing our energies, of developing patience, and of seeing reality objectively."
  - **mental models** - the pictures or heuristics we use to understand the world -- "deeply ingrained assumptions, generalizations, or even pictures or images that influence how we understand the world and how we take action"
  - **shared vision** - building a vision of the shared future we create
  - **team learning** - teams can be more than the sum of their parts by learning -- "When teams are truly learning, not only are they producing extraordinary results but the individual members are growing more rapidly than could have occurred otherwise."
