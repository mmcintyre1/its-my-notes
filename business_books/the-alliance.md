## Chapter 1: Employment in the Networked Age
The employee-employer relationship is based on a dishonest conversation, one where the employee can be fired "at-will" but the employer is asking for loyalty.

This is an old model of employment, meant for an era of stability, when an employee would stay at a company for life. As a result of shareholder capitalism that valued short term profits that required "rightsizing" (firing) to meet short term goals, this paradigm changed.

This old way is too rigid, so companies have often reduced the employee-employer relationship to a legal, binding contract, but this changes companies most valuable resource (talent) to a fungible one in the name of quick profits.

> A business without loyalty is a business without long-term thinking. A business without long-term thinking is a business that’s unable to invest in the future. And a business that isn’t investing in tomorrow’s opportunities and technologies—well, that’s a company already in the process of dying.

> The business world needs a new employment framework that facilitates mutual trust, mutual investment, and mutual benefit.

This book's goal is outlining a framework, an alliance, between employees and employers.

The idea that a company's culture is "family" is flawed -- imagine firing a poorly performing child. The right paradigm is team, which has a specific mission, and its members come together to accomplish that mission.

> [...] the idea of a family still has relevance because it defines how we treat each other—with compassion, appreciation, and respect.

The real value of Silicon Valley is that it is all about the people. In the new economy, the "founder mind-set" or entrepreneurial thinking are the most important. In old world, efficiency was paramount, but that led to higher and higher degrees of specialization, or the infamous buggy-whip manufacturer.

> Today, entrepreneurial thinking and doing are the most important capabilities companies need from their employees.

Two examples:
- John Lasseter started at Disney and after seeing computer-generated animation pitched the idea of making a completely computer-generated movie to Disney. Disney promptly fired him, and he went on to found Pixar. Eventually, Disney bought Pixar for >$7 billion.
- The idea from AWS didn't come from Bezos or the executive team, but a regular employee, Benjamin Black. Eventually Bezos greenlit the project so Black could develop AWS, which is hugely profitable.

Some important questions this book asks:
- How do I build trust and loyalty with my employees if I can’t guarantee lifetime employment?
- How does the alliance apply to different types and levels of employees?
- How do I build a relationship with my entrepreneurial employees when our ultimate goals and values might differ?
- What kind of networking and personal brand building should I allow my employees to do in the workplace?
- How can I run an effective corporate alumni network given limited time and resources?

## Chapter 2: Tours of Duty
> In the context of the alliance, the tour of duty represents an ethical commitment by employer and employee to a specific mission. [...] By recasting careers at your company as a series of successive tours of duty, you can better attract and retain entrepreneurial employees.

Some might be worried that tours of duty framework gives employees permission to leave, but that is a dishonest relationship that an employer should give "permission" for any employee to leave.

These ideas were tested in Silicon Valley, one of the fastest moving, most competitive economies on the planet, where retaining talent is immensely difficult. If they work there, they can work anywhere.

|         The tour of duty framework        |||
| :--------- | :-------- | :--------  | :--------  |
| | Design | Deal | Duration | Transition |
| Rotational | Incoming employees are onboarded programmatically | Assessment of potential future fit at the company; predictable employment | For typical analyst programs, usually on to three years, for other rotational tours, ongoing | Employee may start another rotation or shift to a Transformational tour; little to no moral onus for leaving the company afterward |
| Transformational | Negotiated individually | Transformation of employee's career, transformation of company | Determined by the specific mission, usually two to five years | Prior to completing the mission, employee negotiates new tour at existing company or transition out |
| Foundational | Negotiated individually | For company, a steward of core values, for employee, deep purpose and meaning from work | Ongoing | Both parties anticipate the relationship will be permanent and make their best efforts to stay together |

**Rotational tours** provide scalability by helping companies hire large numbers of employees into stable, well-understood roles.

**Transformational tours** provide adaptability by helping companies bring in the specific skills and experiences required.

**Foundational tours** provide continuity by helping companies retain employees who focus on the long term.
