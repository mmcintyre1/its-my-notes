> If a thing be ordained to another as to its end, its last end cannot consist in the preservationof its being. Hence a captain does not intend as a last end, the preservation of the shipentrusted to him, since a ship is ordained to something else as its end, viz. to navigation.(Often quoted as: If the highest aim of a captain was the preserve his ship, he would keep itin port forever.)
— St. Thomas Aquinas, Summa Theologica (1265–1274)
