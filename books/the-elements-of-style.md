## Elementary rules of usage

1. ### Form the possessive singular of nouns with 's.

    > Charlie<b>'s</b> friend

    > Burn<b>'s</b> poems

    Exceptions are possesives of ancient names in _-es_ and _-is_.

    > Achilles' heel

    > Moses' laws

    Commonly replaced by

    > The heel of Achilles

    > The laws of Moses

2. ### In a series of three or more terms with a single conjunction, use a comma after each term except the last.

    > red<b>,</b> white<b>,</b> and blue

    > honest<b>,</b> energic<b>,</b> but headstrong

    In names of businesses firms the last comma is ommited

    > Brown<b>,</b> Shipley and Company

    **_etc.,_** even if is a single word it always comes preceded by a comma.

3. ### Enclose parenthesic expressions between commas.

    > The best way to see a country<b>, unless are pressed for time,</b> is to travel on foot.

    If the interruption to the flow of the sentence is but slight, the writer may safely omit one or the other comma.

    > Marjorie's husband<b>, Colonel Nelson</b> paid us a visit yesterday,

    or

    > My brother **you will be pleased to hear,** is now in perfect health,

4. ### Place a comma before _and_ or _but_ introducing an independent clause.

    > The early records of the city have disappeared<b>, and</b> the story of its first years can no longer be reconstructed.

    > The situation is perilous<b>, but</b> there is still one chance of escape.

5. ### Do not join independent clauses by a comma.

    The proper mark of punctuation is a semicolon

    > Stevenson's romances are entertaining<b>;</b> they are full of exciting adventures.

    > It is nearly half past five<b>;</b> we cannot reach town before dark.

    It is also correct ro replace semicolons with periods.

    If a conjuntion is inserted the proper punctuation is a comma.

    > Stevenson's romances are entertaining<b>,</b> for they are full of exciting adventures.

6. ### Do not break sentences in two.

    Or basically, don't use periods as commas.

7. ### A participial phrase at the beginning of a sentence must refer to the grammatical subject.

    > **Walking slowly down the road**, **he saw** a woman accompanied by two children.

8. ### Divide words at line-ends, in accordance with their formation and pronunciation.

    A. Devide the word according to its formation
      > know-ledge, de-scribe, atmo-sphere

    B. Devide on the vowels
      > edi-ble, propo-sition, ordi-nary

    C. Devide between double letters
      > apen-nines, Cincin-nati, refer-ring; but tell-ing

## Elementary principles of composition

1. ### Make the paragraph the unit of composition: one paragraph to each topic.

2. ### As a rule, begin each paragraph with a topic sentence; end it in conformity with the beginning.

    Ending with a digression, or with an unimportant detail, is particularly to be avoided.

3. ### Use the active voice.

    The active voice is usually more direct and vigorous than the passive.

    > **I shall always remember my first visit to Boston.**

    Is much better than

    > My first visit to Boston will always be remembered by me.

4. ### Put statements in positive form.

    Make definite assertions. Avoid tame, colorless, hesitating, non-committal language.

    > He was not very often on time.

    > **He usually came late.**

    > He did not think that studying Latin was much use.

    > **He thought the study of Latin useless.**

    It is better to express a negative in positive form.

    > not honest, **dishonest**

    > not important, **trifling**

    > did not remember, **forgot**

5. ### Omit needless words.

    > the question as to whether, **whether**

    > there is no doubt but that, **no doubt**

    > used for fuel purposes, **used for fuel**

    > he is a man who, **he**

6. ### Avoid a succession of loose sentences.

    Loose sentences of a particular type, those consisting of two co-ordinate clauses, the second introduced by a conjunction or relative. Although single sentences of this type may be unexceptionable (see under Rule 4), a series soon becomes monotonous and tedious.

7. ### Express co-ordinate ideas in similar form.

    > The French, the Italians, Spanish, and Portuguese – Bad

    > **The** French, **the** Italians, **the** Spanish, and **the** Portuguese – Good

    > In spring, summer, or in winter – Bad

    > **In** spring<b>,</b> summer<b>,</b> or winter – Good

8. ### Keep related words together.

    > **Wordsworth**, in the fifth book of The Excursion, **gives a minute description of this church**. – Bad

    > In the fifth book of The Excursion, **Wordsworth gives a minute description of this church**. – Good

    > **Cast iron**, when treated in a Bessemer converter, is **changed into steel**. – Bad

    > By treatment in a Bessemer converter, **cast iron** is **changed into steel**. – Good

9. ### In summaries, keep to one tense.

    In summarizing the action of a drama, the writer should always use the present tense. In summarizing a poem, story, or novel, he should preferably use the present, though he may use the past if he prefers.

10. ### Place the emphatic words of a sentence at the end.

    The proper place for the word, or group of words, which the writer desires to make most prominent is usually the end of the sentence.

    > Humanity **has hardly advanced in fortitude** since that time, though it has advanced in many other ways. – Bad

    > Humanity, since that time, has advanced in many other ways, but it **has hardly advanced in fortitude.** – Good

## A few matters of form

- **Headings**. Leave a blank line, after the title or heading of the manuscript. On succeding pages, begin on the first line.
- **Numerals**. Don't spell them, write them in figures or Roman notation.
- **Parentheses**. A sentence containing an expression in parenthesis is punctuated, outside of the marks of parenthesis, exactly as if the expression in parenthesis were absent.
- **Quotations**.
  - Formal quotations as documentary evidence with semicolon an quotation marks

    > The provision of the Constitution is<b>: "No tax or duty shall be laid on articles exported from any state."</b>

  - Quotations grammatically in apposition or the direct objects of verbs are preceded by a comma with quotation marks

    > Aristotle says<b>, "Art is an imitation of nature."</b>

  - Quotations of an entire line, or more, of verse, are begun on a fresh line and centred, but not enclosed in quotation marks.
  - Proverbial expressions and familiar phrases of literary origin require no quotation marks.
- **References**. Give the references in parenthesis or in footnotes, not in the body of the sentence. Omit the words act, scene, line, book, volume, page, except when referring by only one of them.

  > 2 Samuel i:17-27

  > Othello II.iii 264-267, III.iii. 155-161

- **Titles**. Italics with capitalized initials.

  > The _Iliad_; the _Odyssey_; _As You Like It_; _To a Skylark_; The Newcomes.

## Words and expressions commonly misused

- **_Claim_**. Not to be used as a subsitute for _declare_, _maintain_, or _charge_.

- **_Fix_**. In writing restrict it to its senses, _fasten_, _make firm or immovable_, etc.
- **_He is a man who_**. Redundant.
- **_However_**. In the meaning of _nevertheless_, not to come first in its sentence or clause.
- **_Kind of_**. Not to be used as a replacement for _rather_. Prefer to use _something like_. Same for _sort of_.

- **_Whom_**. Often incorrectly used for who before _he said_ or similar expressions.
- **_Worth while_**. Try to avoid it. Can be applied for actions.
- **_Would_**.
  A conditional statement in the first person requires _should_, not _would_.

  > I should not have succeeded without his help.

  The equivalent of _shall_ in indirect quotation after a verb in the past tense is _should_, not _would_.

  > He predicted that before long we should have a great surprise.

  To express habitual or repeated action, the past tense, without would, is usually sufficient, and from its brevity, more emphatic.

  > Once a year he would visit the old mansion. – Bad

  > Once a year he visited the old mansion. – Good
