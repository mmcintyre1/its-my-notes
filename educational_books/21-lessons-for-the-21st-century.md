# 21 Lessons for the 21st Century
Yuval Noah Harrari, 2018

# Disillusionment
- the 21st century had three dominant stories:
  - **fascism** - history as a struggle among different nations, world is dominated by one human group that violently subdues all others
  - **communism** - history as struggle among different classes, world is all groups united by centralized system that ensures equality at price of freedom
  - **liberalism** - history as struggle between liberty and tyranny, world is all humans cooperate freely and peacefully with minimal central control even at price of some inequality
- liberalism became the dominant story after the fall of fascism after WWII and the fall of communism after USSR
- recently, liberalism has been rejected -- we see this in election of Trump, or Brexit, for example. A rejection of the thrust of globalization (while still maintaining some tenets of liberalism at home)
- liberalism hasn't been replaced by a "new story", and humans need stories to function as groups
- everyone embraces some form of liberalism (except for parts of the Middle East) -- China has massive infrastructure spending (Belt-and-Road initiative - modern day Silk Road), Trump is in favor of free markets, etc.
- nostalgic backwards thrust of humanity in 2010s -- Trump's Make America Great, Putin wanted to reinstate tsarist empire, Middle East wanting to teleport back 1,500 years

# Work
- humans have two types of abilities: cognitive and physical -- in the past machines have competed with humans in the physical, but now AI is outperforming humans in the cognitive too
- human intuition really is just pattern recognition, humans reacting to millions of biochemical signals to do things
- AI allows for connectability and updatability -- all machines have much less lossy exchange of information than humans, and you can update all machines at once with new software
- 1.25 million people killed annually in traffic accidents, the majority due to human error -- reasonable to assume that AI driving would cut ~90% of those
- *rise of the useless caste* - many low skill jobs are being completely lost to automation, but high skill jobs are plentiful -- losing a low skill job without being able to switch to another low skill job means humans need to either gain new skills or become useless
- disruption by automation won't just be a single event but a cascade of disruptions

three ways to think about job loss
  1. how to stop job loss
  2. how to create new jobs
  3. what to do if lost jobs outpaces created jobs

two solutions are:
1. universal basic income (capitalist utopia) - govt provides stipend to live
2. universal basic services (communist utopia) - govt provides all basic services for free

# Liberty
- referendums are always about human feelings not rationality
- feelings are biochemical reactions that all mammals and birds have to quickly calculate probabilities of survival
- trolley problem -- save children or trolley operator and passengers? applies to self-driving cars
- human emotions trump philosophical ideas and humans use emotions to make life or death decisions
- good samaritan study -- theologians on way to present talk about good samaritan story frequently pass by a homeless man on the street coughing and moaning in pain
- in moments of crisis, computers would follow ethical guidelines better than humans, as there is no emotional baggage
- computers just need to be better than humans
- science fiction posits that the day robots take over is when they achieve "consciousness", but this equates consciousness with intelligence
- consciousness is either 1) linked to organic systems in such a way that prevents anything else from achieving it 2) can be achieved by inorganic entities and is essential to achieve a certain level of intelligence 3) there is no link between consciousness and high intelligence and it is not required

**MM Note:** Harrari has a tendency so far in this book to over-simplify ideas, such as implying that these "algorithms" are some conglomerate and are working in concert to hack humanity. There is a bit of fear-mongering of these "algorithms" as if they aren't just very complicated statistical models limited to a few thousand features. Netflix has dedicated millions of engineering hours to its recommendation system, and it doesn't seem entirely reliable. Humans aren't just some interface with 1,000 buttons that a computer could learn to play like a piano. We are decades away from algorithms being able to take in enough inputs to mimic even small subsets of human action or emotion.
