# Ultralearning

## ultralearning
- strategy for acquisition of skills and knowledge that is both **intense** and **self-directed**

## skill polarization
- high skill and low skill jobs replace medium skill jobs, driving income inequality that increases at the extremes

## Metalearning
- how we think about learning itself
- the map we draw for our learning
- answer the why, what, and how of learning:
  - why: understanding motivation, can be driven through *expert interviews* to vet your project merits
  - what: knowledge and abilities required to be successful, can write *concepts*, *facts*, and *procedures* to be learned
  - how: resources, environment, method for learning, can *benchmark* against path that already exists (e.g.,  curricula) or *emphasize/exclude* by amplifying that which enables goals, omitting what doesn't

## Focus
- ability to concentrate, can be broken up into *starting*, *sustaining*, and *optimizing*
- **procrastination**:
  - recognize when you are doing it
  - get over initial unpleasantness of starting
  - *pomodoro technique*: 25 minutes on with 5 minute break
- **distraction**:
  - 2 states of focus: *delivery practice* and *flow*
  - large periods of focus might not be optimal, ~1 hour might be best
  - multitasking is not good for learning
  - environment, task, and mind are all sources of distraction
- **sustaining**:
  - need right levels of arousal based on task at hand

## Directness
- learning being tied to situation or context you want to use your learning in
- *transference* - learn something in one context and use in another
- *formal discipline theory* - now defunct idea that brain is a muscle and general training has mental benefits
- ways to induce directness:
  - projects
  - immersion
  - simulation
  - overtraining

## Drill
- isolate parts of a skill to focus on, then integrate those parts to the whole
- practice skill directly, analyze skill and break into components to practice individually, then back to direct practice and integrate

## Retrieval
- trying to recall concepts from memory
- it is better to try and recall something from memory (self-testing) than passively reading notes or creating a mental concept map
- *judgments of learning* - how well we think we know something
- *desirable difficulty* - retrieval is better learning if act of retrieval is successful
- *forward testing effect* - retrieval helps general learning in the future as well
- methods for retrieval:
  - flash cards: ideal for cue/response
  - free recall: remember as much as you can
  - question book: take notes as questions to be answered in review
  - self-generated challenge: create a challenge for later
  - closed book learning: draw concept map without the book

## Feedback
- more feedback isn't always better -- effect on motivation is key
- feedback aimed at ego is less effective
- best feedback is "informative and useful"
- *outcome feedback*: binary feedback, are you doing it right or wrong, least granular
- *informational feedback* - tells you what you are doing wrong but not how to fix it
- *corrective feedback* - tells you what you were doing wrong and how to fix it
  - usually only available through coach or mentor
- concentrate on the signal over the noise
- assess how feedback is affecting learning rate (meta-feedback)
- high-intensity, rapid feedback might be occasionally useful

## Retention
- *forgetting curve* - discovered by Ebbinghaus, initial forgetting spikes immediately after learning and lessens over time
- theories on why we forget:
  - decay: memories disappear over time
  - interference: some memories overwrite others
  - forgotten cues: we forget the cue to bring the memory up
- ways to retain memories:
  - *spaced repetition*: lots of science behind this, helpful for cue/response -> spreading retrieval over time leads to more effective learning
  - *proceduralization*: automatic memories are far more durable, so learn important, widely needed skills to automatic memories
  - *overlearning*: practice beyond what is necessary to succeed
  - *mnemonics*: access memories via keyword or spatial map (like memory palace) - a bit more brittle and limited in use cases than it appears

## Intuition
- having enough experience to be able to run new evidence against mental models to make predictions about how things work
- methods for building intuition:
  - don't give up on problems too easily
  - use concrete examples to check learning
  - ask a lot of questions
  - take time to actually prove things
  - think about how you would convey a concept to someone who doesn't know, or, if it's a problem, explain how you would solve it and why that solution makes sense

## Experimentation
- need to experiment to find your own path, differentiate yourself in master, and lessen the stagnation of skills after learning the basics
- you can experiment with:
  - methods, resources, & materials for learning
  - what to learn after the basics
  - what style to use
- *growth vs. fixed mindset* - growth mindset believes that humans can improve their inherent ability to learn, while fixed says that mental capacity is fixed
- some ways to experiment:
  - copy, then create
  - A/B testing of methods
  - introducing new constraints
  - hybrid of skills (e.g., communication and programming)
  - pursue the extremes
